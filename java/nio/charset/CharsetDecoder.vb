    ''' <summary>
    ''' An engine that can transform a sequence of bytes in a specific charset into a sequence of
    ''' sixteen-bit Unicode characters.
    ''' 
    ''' <a name="steps"></a>
    ''' 
    ''' <p> The input byte sequence is provided in a byte buffer or a series
    ''' of such buffers.  The output character sequence is written to a character buffer
    ''' or a series of such buffers.  A decoder should always be used by making
    ''' the following sequence of method invocations, hereinafter referred to as a
    ''' <i>decoding operation</i>:
    ''' 
    ''' <ol>
    ''' 
    '''   <li><p> Reset the decoder via the <seealso cref="#reset reset"/> method, unless it
    '''   has not been used before; </p></li>
    ''' 
    '''   <li><p> Invoke the <seealso cref="#decode decode"/> method zero or more times, as
    '''   long as additional input may be available, passing <tt>false</tt> for the
    '''   <tt>endOfInput</tt> argument and filling the input buffer and flushing the
    '''   output buffer between invocations; </p></li>
    ''' 
    '''   <li><p> Invoke the <seealso cref="#decode decode"/> method one final time, passing
    '''   <tt>true</tt> for the <tt>endOfInput</tt> argument; and then </p></li>
    ''' 
    '''   <li><p> Invoke the <seealso cref="#flush flush"/> method so that the decoder can
    '''   flush any internal state to the output buffer. </p></li>
    ''' 
    ''' </ol>
    ''' 
    ''' Each invocation of the <seealso cref="#decode decode"/> method will decode as many
    ''' bytes as possible from the input buffer, writing the resulting characters
    ''' to the output buffer.  The <seealso cref="#decode decode"/> method returns when more
    ''' input is required, when there is not enough room in the output buffer, or
    ''' when a decoding error has occurred.  In each case a <seealso cref="CoderResult"/>
    ''' object is returned to describe the reason for termination.  An invoker can
    ''' examine this object and fill the input buffer, flush the output buffer, or
    ''' attempt to recover from a decoding error, as appropriate, and try again.
    ''' 
    ''' <a name="ce"></a>
    ''' 
    ''' <p> There are two general types of decoding errors.  If the input byte
    ''' sequence is not legal for this charset then the input is considered <i>malformed</i>.  If
    ''' the input byte sequence is legal but cannot be mapped to a valid
    ''' Unicode character then an <i>unmappable character</i> has been encountered.
    ''' 
    ''' <a name="cae"></a>
    ''' 
    ''' <p> How a decoding error is handled depends upon the action requested for
    ''' that type of error, which is described by an instance of the {@link
    ''' CodingErrorAction} class.  The possible error actions are to {@linkplain
    ''' CodingErrorAction#IGNORE ignore} the erroneous input, {@linkplain
    ''' CodingErrorAction#REPORT report} the error to the invoker via
    ''' the returned <seealso cref="CoderResult"/> object, or {@link CodingErrorAction#REPLACE
    ''' replace} the erroneous input with the current value of the
    ''' replacement string.  The replacement
    ''' 
    ''' 
    ''' 
    ''' 
    ''' 
    ''' 
    ''' has the initial value <tt>"&#92;uFFFD"</tt>;
    ''' 
    ''' 
    ''' its value may be changed via the {@link #replaceWith(java.lang.String)
    ''' replaceWith} method.
    ''' 
    ''' <p> The default action for malformed-input and unmappable-character errors
    ''' is to <seealso cref="CodingErrorAction#REPORT report"/> them.  The
    ''' malformed-input error action may be changed via the {@link
    ''' #onMalformedInput(CodingErrorAction) onMalformedInput} method; the
    ''' unmappable-character action may be changed via the {@link
    ''' #onUnmappableCharacter(CodingErrorAction) onUnmappableCharacter} method.
    ''' 
    ''' <p> This class is designed to handle many of the details of the decoding
    ''' process, including the implementation of error actions.  A decoder for a
    ''' specific charset, which is a concrete subclass of this [Class], need only
    ''' implement the abstract <seealso cref="#decodeLoop decodeLoop"/> method, which
    ''' encapsulates the basic decoding loop.  A subclass that maintains internal
    ''' state should, additionally, override the <seealso cref="#implFlush implFlush"/> and
    ''' <seealso cref="#implReset implReset"/> methods.
    ''' 
    ''' <p> Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent
    ''' threads.  </p>
