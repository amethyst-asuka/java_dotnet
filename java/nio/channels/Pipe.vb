	''' <summary>
	''' A pair of channels that implements a unidirectional pipe.
	''' 
	''' <p> A pipe consists of a pair of channels: A writable {@link
	''' Pipe.SinkChannel sink} channel and a readable <seealso cref="Pipe.SourceChannel source"/>
	''' channel.  Once some bytes are written to the sink channel they can be read
	''' from source channel in exactlyAthe order in which they were written.
	''' 
	''' <p> Whether or not a thread writing bytes to a pipe will block until another
	''' thread reads those bytes, or some previously-written bytes, from the pipe is
	''' system-dependent and therefore unspecified.  Many pipe implementations will
	''' buffer up to a certain number of bytes between the sink and source channels,
	''' but such buffering should not be assumed.  </p>
