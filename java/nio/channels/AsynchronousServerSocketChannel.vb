	''' <summary>
	''' An asynchronous channel for stream-oriented listening sockets.
	''' 
	''' <p> An asynchronous server-socket channel is created by invoking the
	''' <seealso cref="#open open"/> method of this class.
	''' A newly-created asynchronous server-socket channel is open but not yet bound.
	''' It can be bound to a local address and configured to listen for connections
	''' by invoking the <seealso cref="#bind(SocketAddress,int) bind"/> method. Once bound,
	''' the <seealso cref="#accept(Object,CompletionHandler) accept"/> method
	''' is used to initiate the accepting of connections to the channel's socket.
	''' An attempt to invoke the <tt>accept</tt> method on an unbound channel will
	''' cause a <seealso cref="NotYetBoundException"/> to be thrown.
	''' 
	''' <p> Channels of this type are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads
	''' though at most one accept operation can be outstanding at any time.
	''' If a thread initiates an accept operation before a previous accept operation
	''' has completed then an <seealso cref="AcceptPendingException"/> will be thrown.
	''' 
	''' <p> Socket options are configured using the {@link #setOption(SocketOption,Object)
	''' setOption} method. Channels of this type support the following options:
	''' <blockquote>
	''' <table border summary="Socket options">
	'''   <tr>
	'''     <th>Option Name</th>
	'''     <th>Description</th>
	'''   </tr>
	'''   <tr>
	'''     <td> <seealso cref="java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF"/> </td>
	'''     <td> The size of the socket receive buffer </td>
	'''   </tr>
	'''   <tr>
	'''     <td> <seealso cref="java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR"/> </td>
	'''     <td> Re-use address </td>
	'''   </tr>
	''' </table>
	''' </blockquote>
	''' Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported.
	''' 
	''' <p> <b>Usage Example:</b>
	''' <pre>
	'''  final AsynchronousServerSocketChannel listener =
	'''      AsynchronousServerSocketChannel.open().bind(new InetSocketAddress(5000));
	''' 
	'''  listener.accept(null, new CompletionHandler&lt;AsynchronousSocketChannel,Void&gt;() {
	'''      public  Sub  completed(AsynchronousSocketChannel ch,  Sub  att) {
	'''          // accept the next connection
	'''          listener.accept(null, this);
	''' 
	'''          // handle this connection
	'''          handle(ch);
	'''      }
	'''      public  Sub  failed(Throwable exc,  Sub  att) {
	'''          ...
	'''      }
	'''  });
