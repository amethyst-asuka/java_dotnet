	''' <summary>
	''' A selectable channel for stream-oriented connecting sockets.
	''' 
	''' <p> A socket channel is created by invoking one of the <seealso cref="#open open"/>
	''' methods of this class.  It is not possible to create a channel for an arbitrary,
	''' pre-existing socket. A newly-created socket channel is open but not yet
	''' connected.  An attempt to invoke an I/O operation upon an unconnected
	''' channel will cause a <seealso cref="NotYetConnectedException"/> to be thrown.  A
	''' socket channel can be connected by invoking its <seealso cref="#connect connect"/>
	''' method; once connected, a socket channel remains connected until it is
	''' closed.  Whether or not a socket channel is connected may be determined by
	''' invoking its <seealso cref="#isConnected isConnected"/> method.
	''' 
	''' <p> Socket channels support <i>non-blocking connection:</i>&nbsp;A socket
	''' channel may be created and the process of establishing the link to the
	''' remote socket may be initiated via the <seealso cref="#connect connect"/> method for
	''' later completion by the <seealso cref="#finishConnect finishConnect"/> method.
	''' Whether or not a connection operation is in progress may be determined by
	''' invoking the <seealso cref="#isConnectionPending isConnectionPending"/> method.
	''' 
	''' <p> Socket channels support <i>asynchronous shutdown,</i> which is similar
	''' to the asynchronous close operation specified in the <seealso cref="Channel"/> class.
	''' If the input side of a socket is shut down by one thread while another
	''' thread is blocked in a read operation on the socket's channel, then the read
	''' operation in the blocked thread will complete without reading any bytes and
	''' will return <tt>-1</tt>.  If the output side of a socket is shut down by one
	''' thread while another thread is blocked in a write operation on the socket's
	''' channel, then the blocked thread will receive an {@link
	''' AsynchronousCloseException}.
	''' 
	''' <p> Socket options are configured using the {@link #setOption(SocketOption,Object)
	''' setOption} method. Socket channels support the following options:
	''' <blockquote>
	''' <table border summary="Socket options">
	'''   <tr>
	'''     <th>Option Name</th>
	'''     <th>Description</th>
	'''   </tr>
	'''   <tr>
	'''     <td> <seealso cref="java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_SNDBUF SO_SNDBUF"/> </td>
	'''     <td> The size of the socket send buffer </td>
	'''   </tr>
	'''   <tr>
	'''     <td> <seealso cref="java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF"/> </td>
	'''     <td> The size of the socket receive buffer </td>
	'''   </tr>
	'''   <tr>
	'''     <td> <seealso cref="java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_KEEPALIVE SO_KEEPALIVE"/> </td>
	'''     <td> Keep connection alive </td>
	'''   </tr>
	'''   <tr>
	'''     <td> <seealso cref="java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR"/> </td>
	'''     <td> Re-use address </td>
	'''   </tr>
	'''   <tr>
	'''     <td> <seealso cref="java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_LINGER SO_LINGER"/> </td>
	'''     <td> Linger on close if data is present (when configured in blocking mode
	'''          only) </td>
	'''   </tr>
	'''   <tr>
	'''     <td> <seealso cref="java.net.StandardSocketOptions#TCP_NODELAY TCP_NODELAY"/> </td>
	'''     <td> Disable the Nagle algorithm </td>
	'''   </tr>
	''' </table>
	''' </blockquote>
	''' Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported.
	''' 
	''' <p> Socket channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.  They
	''' support concurrent reading and writing, though at most one thread may be
	''' reading and at most one thread may be writing at any given time.  The {@link
	''' #connect connect} and <seealso cref="#finishConnect finishConnect"/> methods are
	''' mutually synchronized against each other, and an attempt to initiate a read
	''' or write operation while an invocation of one of these methods is in
	''' progress will block until that invocation is complete.  </p>
