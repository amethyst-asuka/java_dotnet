	''' <summary>
	''' A selectable channel for stream-oriented listening sockets.
	''' 
	''' <p> A server-socket channel is created by invoking the <seealso cref="#open() open"/>
	''' method of this class.  It is not possible to create a channel for an arbitrary,
	''' pre-existing <seealso cref="ServerSocket"/>. A newly-created server-socket channel is
	''' open but not yet bound.  An attempt to invoke the <seealso cref="#accept() accept"/>
	''' method of an unbound server-socket channel will cause a <seealso cref="NotYetBoundException"/>
	''' to be thrown. A server-socket channel can be bound by invoking one of the
	''' <seealso cref="#bind(java.net.SocketAddress,int) bind"/> methods defined by this class.
	''' 
	''' <p> Socket options are configured using the {@link #setOption(SocketOption,Object)
	''' setOption} method. Server-socket channels support the following options:
	''' <blockquote>
	''' <table border summary="Socket options">
	'''   <tr>
	'''     <th>Option Name</th>
	'''     <th>Description</th>
	'''   </tr>
	'''   <tr>
	'''     <td> <seealso cref="java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF"/> </td>
	'''     <td> The size of the socket receive buffer </td>
	'''   </tr>
	'''   <tr>
	'''     <td> <seealso cref="java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR"/> </td>
	'''     <td> Re-use address </td>
	'''   </tr>
	''' </table>
	''' </blockquote>
	''' Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported.
	''' 
	''' <p> Server-socket channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
