	''' <summary>
	''' Base implementation class for selectors.
	''' 
	''' <p> This class encapsulates the low-level machinery required to implement
	''' the interruption of selection operations.  A concrete selector class must
	''' invoke the <seealso cref="#begin begin"/> and <seealso cref="#end end"/> methods before and
	''' after, respectively, invoking an I/O operation that might block
	''' indefinitely.  In order to ensure that the <seealso cref="#end end"/> method is always
	''' invoked, these methods should be used within a
	''' <tt>try</tt>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<tt>finally</tt> block:
	''' 
	''' <blockquote><pre>
	''' try {
	'''     begin();
	'''     // Perform blocking I/O operation here
	'''     ...
	''' } finally {
	'''     end();
	''' }</pre></blockquote>
	''' 
	''' <p> This class also defines methods for maintaining a selector's
	''' cancelled-key set and for removing a key from its channel's key set, and
	''' declares the abstract <seealso cref="#register register"/> method that is invoked by a
	''' selectable channel's <seealso cref="AbstractSelectableChannel#register register"/>
	''' method in order to perform the actual work of registering a channel.  </p>
