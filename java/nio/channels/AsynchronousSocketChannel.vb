	''' <summary>
	''' An asynchronous channel for stream-oriented connecting sockets.
	''' 
	''' <p> Asynchronous socket channels are created in one of two ways. A newly-created
	''' {@code AsynchronousSocketChannel} is created by invoking one of the {@link
	''' #open open} methods defined by this class. A newly-created channel is open but
	''' not yet connected. A connected {@code AsynchronousSocketChannel} is created
	''' when a connection is made to the socket of an <seealso cref="AsynchronousServerSocketChannel"/>.
	''' It is not possible to create an asynchronous socket channel for an arbitrary,
	''' pre-existing <seealso cref="java.net.Socket socket"/>.
	''' 
	''' <p> A newly-created channel is connected by invoking its <seealso cref="#connect connect"/>
	''' method; once connected, a channel remains connected until it is closed.  Whether
	''' or not a socket channel is connected may be determined by invoking its {@link
	''' #getRemoteAddress getRemoteAddress} method. An attempt to invoke an I/O
	''' operation upon an unconnected channel will cause a <seealso cref="NotYetConnectedException"/>
	''' to be thrown.
	''' 
	''' <p> Channels of this type are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
	''' They support concurrent reading and writing, though at most one read operation
	''' and one write operation can be outstanding at any time.
	''' If a thread initiates a read operation before a previous read operation has
	''' completed then a <seealso cref="ReadPendingException"/> will be thrown. Similarly, an
	''' attempt to initiate a write operation before a previous write has completed
	''' will throw a <seealso cref="WritePendingException"/>.
	''' 
	''' <p> Socket options are configured using the {@link #setOption(SocketOption,Object)
	''' setOption} method. Asynchronous socket channels support the following options:
	''' <blockquote>
	''' <table border summary="Socket options">
	'''   <tr>
	'''     <th>Option Name</th>
	'''     <th>Description</th>
	'''   </tr>
	'''   <tr>
	'''     <td> <seealso cref="java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_SNDBUF SO_SNDBUF"/> </td>
	'''     <td> The size of the socket send buffer </td>
	'''   </tr>
	'''   <tr>
	'''     <td> <seealso cref="java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF"/> </td>
	'''     <td> The size of the socket receive buffer </td>
	'''   </tr>
	'''   <tr>
	'''     <td> <seealso cref="java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_KEEPALIVE SO_KEEPALIVE"/> </td>
	'''     <td> Keep connection alive </td>
	'''   </tr>
	'''   <tr>
	'''     <td> <seealso cref="java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR"/> </td>
	'''     <td> Re-use address </td>
	'''   </tr>
	'''   <tr>
	'''     <td> <seealso cref="java.net.StandardSocketOptions#TCP_NODELAY TCP_NODELAY"/> </td>
	'''     <td> Disable the Nagle algorithm </td>
	'''   </tr>
	''' </table>
	''' </blockquote>
	''' Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported.
	''' 
	''' <h2>Timeouts</h2>
	''' 
	''' <p> The <seealso cref="#read(ByteBuffer,long,TimeUnit,Object,CompletionHandler) read"/>
	''' and <seealso cref="#write(ByteBuffer,long,TimeUnit,Object,CompletionHandler) write"/>
	''' methods defined by this class allow a timeout to be specified when initiating
	''' a read or write operation. If the timeout elapses before an operation completes
	''' then the operation completes with the exception {@link
	''' InterruptedByTimeoutException}. A timeout may leave the channel, or the
	''' underlying connection, in an inconsistent state. Where the implementation
	''' cannot guarantee that bytes have not been read from the channel then it puts
	''' the channel into an implementation specific <em>error state</em>. A subsequent
	''' attempt to initiate a {@code read} operation causes an unspecified runtime
	''' exception to be thrown. Similarly if a {@code write} operation times out and
	''' the implementation cannot guarantee bytes have not been written to the
	''' channel then further attempts to {@code write} to the channel cause an
	''' unspecified runtime exception to be thrown. When a timeout elapses then the
	''' state of the <seealso cref="ByteBuffer"/>, or the sequence of buffers, for the I/O
	''' operation is not defined. Buffers should be discarded or at least care must
	''' be taken to ensure that the buffers are not accessed while the channel remains
	''' open. All methods that accept timeout parameters treat values less than or
	''' equal to zero to mean that the I/O operation does not timeout.
	''' 
	''' @since 1.7

		''' <summary>
		''' Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from a subsequence of the given
		''' buffers. This operation, sometimes called a <em>gathering write</em>, is
		''' often useful when implementing network protocols that group data into
		''' segments consisting of one or more fixed-length headers followed by a
		''' variable-length body. The {@code handler} parameter is a completion
		''' handler that is invoked when the write operation completes (or fails).
		''' The result passed to the completion handler is the number of bytes written.
		''' 
		''' <p> This method initiates a write of up to <i>r</i> bytes to this channel,
		''' where <i>r</i> is the total number of bytes remaining in the specified
		''' subsequence of the given buffer array, that is,
		''' 
		''' <blockquote><pre>
		''' srcs[offset].remaining()
		'''     + srcs[offset+1].remaining()
		'''     + ... + srcs[offset+length-1].remaining()</pre></blockquote>
		''' 
		''' at the moment that the write is attempted.
		''' 
		''' <p> Suppose that a byte sequence of length <i>n</i> is written, where
		''' <tt>0</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&lt;</tt>&nbsp;<i>n</i>&nbsp;<tt>&lt;=</tt>&nbsp;<i>r</i>.
		''' Up to the first <tt>srcs[offset].remaining()</tt> bytes of this sequence
		''' are written from buffer <tt>srcs[offset]</tt>, up to the next
		''' <tt>srcs[offset+1].remaining()</tt> bytes are written from buffer
		''' <tt>srcs[offset+1]</tt>, and so forth, until the entire byte sequence is
		''' written.  As many bytes as possible are written from each buffer, hence
		''' the final position of each updated buffer, except the last updated
		''' buffer, is guaranteed to be equal to that buffer's limit. The underlying
		''' operating system may impose a limit on the number of buffers that may be
		''' used in an I/O operation. Where the number of buffers (with bytes
		''' remaining), exceeds this limit, then the I/O operation is performed with
		''' the maximum number of buffers allowed by the operating system.
		''' 
		''' <p> If a timeout is specified and the timeout elapses before the operation
		''' completes then it completes with the exception {@link
		''' InterruptedByTimeoutException}. Where a timeout occurs, and the
		''' implementation cannot guarantee that bytes have not been written, or will
		''' not be written to the channel from the given buffers, then further attempts
		''' to write to the channel will cause an unspecific runtime exception to be
		''' thrown.
