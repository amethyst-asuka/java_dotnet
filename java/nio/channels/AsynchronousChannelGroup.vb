	''' <summary>
	''' A grouping of asynchronous channels for the purpose of resource sharing.
	''' 
	''' <p> An asynchronous channel group encapsulates the mechanics required to
	''' handle the completion of I/O operations initiated by {@link AsynchronousChannel
	''' asynchronous channels} that are bound to the group. A group has an associated
	''' thread pool to which tasks are submitted to handle I/O events and dispatch to
	''' <seealso cref="CompletionHandler completion-handlers"/> that consume the result of
	''' asynchronous operations performed on channels in the group. In addition to
	''' handling I/O events, the pooled threads may also execute other tasks required
	''' to support the execution of asynchronous I/O operations.
	''' 
	''' <p> An asynchronous channel group is created by invoking the {@link
	''' #withFixedThreadPool withFixedThreadPool} or {@link #withCachedThreadPool
	''' withCachedThreadPool} methods defined here. Channels are bound to a group by
	''' specifying the group when constructing the channel. The associated thread
	''' pool is <em>owned</em> by the group; termination of the group results in the
	''' shutdown of the associated thread pool.
	''' 
	''' <p> In addition to groups created explicitly, the Java virtual machine
	''' maintains a system-wide <em>default group</em> that is constructed
	''' automatically. Asynchronous channels that do not specify a group at
	''' construction time are bound to the default group. The default group has an
	''' associated thread pool that creates new threads as needed. The default group
	''' may be configured by means of system properties defined in the table below.
	''' Where the <seealso cref="java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory ThreadFactory"/> for the
	''' default group is not configured then the pooled threads of the default group
	''' are <seealso cref="Thread#isDaemon daemon"/> threads.
	''' 
	''' <table border summary="System properties">
	'''   <tr>
	'''     <th>System property</th>
	'''     <th>Description</th>
	'''   </tr>
	'''   <tr>
	'''     <td> {@code java.nio.channels.DefaultThreadPool.threadFactory} </td>
	'''     <td> The value of this property is taken to be the fully-qualified name
	'''     of a concrete <seealso cref="java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory ThreadFactory"/>
	'''     class. The class is loaded using the system class loader and instantiated.
	'''     The factory's {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory#newThread
	'''     newThread} method is invoked to create each thread for the default
	'''     group's thread pool. If the process to load and instantiate the value
	'''     of the property fails then an unspecified error is thrown during the
	'''     construction of the default group. </td>
	'''   </tr>
	'''   <tr>
	'''     <td> {@code java.nio.channels.DefaultThreadPool.initialSize} </td>
	'''     <td> The value of the {@code initialSize} parameter for the default
	'''     group (see <seealso cref="#withCachedThreadPool withCachedThreadPool"/>).
	'''     The value of the property is taken to be the {@code String}
	'''     representation of an {@code Integer} that is the initial size parameter.
	'''     If the value cannot be parsed as an {@code Integer} it causes an
	'''     unspecified error to be thrown during the construction of the default
	'''     group. </td>
	'''   </tr>
	''' </table>
	''' 
	''' <a name="threading"></a><h2>Threading</h2>
	''' 
	''' <p> The completion handler for an I/O operation initiated on a channel bound
	''' to a group is guaranteed to be invoked by one of the pooled threads in the
	''' group. This ensures that the completion handler is run by a thread with the
	''' expected <em>identity</em>.
	''' 
	''' <p> Where an I/O operation completes immediately, and the initiating thread
	''' is one of the pooled threads in the group then the completion handler may
	''' be invoked directly by the initiating thread. To avoid stack overflow, an
	''' implementation may impose a limit as to the number of activations on the
	''' thread stack. Some I/O operations may prohibit invoking the completion
	''' handler directly by the initiating thread (see {@link
	''' AsynchronousServerSocketChannel#accept(Object,CompletionHandler) accept}).
	''' 
	''' <a name="shutdown"></a><h2>Shutdown and Termination</h2>
	''' 
	''' <p> The <seealso cref="#shutdown() shutdown"/> method is used to initiate an <em>orderly
	''' shutdown</em> of a group. An orderly shutdown marks the group as shutdown;
	''' further attempts to construct a channel that binds to the group will throw
	''' <seealso cref="ShutdownChannelGroupException"/>. Whether or not a group is shutdown can
	''' be tested using the <seealso cref="#isShutdown() isShutdown"/> method. Once shutdown,
	''' the group <em>terminates</em> when all asynchronous channels that are bound to
	''' the group are closed, all actively executing completion handlers have run to
	''' completion, and resources used by the group are released. No attempt is made
	''' to stop or interrupt threads that are executing completion handlers. The
	''' <seealso cref="#isTerminated() isTerminated"/> method is used to test if the group has
	''' terminated, and the <seealso cref="#awaitTermination awaitTermination"/> method can be
	''' used to block until the group has terminated.
	''' 
	''' <p> The <seealso cref="#shutdownNow() shutdownNow"/> method can be used to initiate a
	''' <em>forceful shutdown</em> of the group. In addition to the actions performed
	''' by an orderly shutdown, the {@code shutdownNow} method closes all open channels
	''' in the group as if by invoking the <seealso cref="AsynchronousChannel#close close"/>
	''' method.
