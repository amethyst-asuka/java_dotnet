	''' <summary>
	''' A handler for consuming the result of an asynchronous I/O operation.
	''' 
	''' <p> The asynchronous channels defined in this package allow a completion
	''' handler to be specified to consume the result of an asynchronous operation.
	''' The <seealso cref="#completed completed"/> method is invoked when the I/O operation
	''' completes successfully. The <seealso cref="#failed failed"/> method is invoked if the
	''' I/O operations fails. The implementations of these methods should complete
	''' in a timely manner so as to avoid keeping the invoking thread from dispatching
	''' to other completion handlers.
	''' </summary>
	''' @param   <V>     The result type of the I/O operation </param>
	''' @param   <A>     The type of the object attached to the I/O operation
	''' 
	''' @since 1.7 </param>
