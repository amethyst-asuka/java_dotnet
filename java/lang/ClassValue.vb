		''' Removes the associated value for the given class.

		''' This may result in an additional invocation of the
		''' {@code computeValue} method for the given class.
		''' <p>
		''' In order to explain the interaction between {@code get} and {@code remove} calls,
		''' we must model the state transitions of a class value to take into account
		''' the alternation between uninitialized and initialized states.
		''' To do this, number these states sequentially from zero, and note that
		''' uninitialized (or removed) states are numbered with even numbers,
		''' while initialized (or re-initialized) states have odd numbers.
		''' <p>
		''' When a thread {@code T} removes a class value in state {@code 2N},
		''' nothing happens, since the class value is already uninitialized.
		''' Otherwise, the state is advanced atomically to {@code 2N+1}.
		''' <p>
		''' When a thread {@code T} queries a class value in state {@code 2N},
		''' the thread first attempts to initialize the class value to state {@code 2N+1}
		''' by invoking {@code computeValue} and installing the resulting value.
		''' <p>
		''' When {@code T} attempts to install the newly computed value,
		''' if the state is still at {@code 2N}, the class value will be initialized
		''' with the computed value, advancing it to state {@code 2N+1}.
		''' <p>
		''' Otherwise, whether the new state is even or odd,
		''' {@code T} will discard the newly computed value
		''' and retry the {@code get} operation.
		''' <p>
		''' Discarding and retrying is an important proviso,
		''' since otherwise {@code T} could potentially install
		''' a disastrously stale value.  For example:
		''' <ul>
		''' <li>{@code T} calls {@code CV.get(C)} and sees state {@code 2N}
		''' <li>{@code T} quickly computes a time-dependent value {@code V0} and gets ready to install it
		''' <li>{@code T} is hit by an unlucky paging or scheduling event, and goes to sleep for a long time
		''' <li>...meanwhile, {@code T2} also calls {@code CV.get(C)} and sees state {@code 2N}
		''' <li>{@code T2} quickly computes a similar time-dependent value {@code V1} and installs it on {@code CV.get(C)}
		''' <li>{@code T2} (or a third thread) then calls {@code CV.remove(C)}, undoing {@code T2}'s work
		''' <li> the previous actions of {@code T2} are repeated several times
		''' <li> also, the relevant computed values change over time: {@code V1}, {@code V2}, ...
		''' <li>...meanwhile, {@code T} wakes up and attempts to install {@code V0}; <em>this must fail</em>
		''' </ul>
		''' We can assume in the above scenario that {@code CV.computeValue} uses locks to properly
		''' observe the time-dependent states as it computes {@code V1}, etc.
		''' This does not remove the threat of a stale value, since there is a window of time
		''' between the return of {@code computeValue} in {@code T} and the installation
		''' of the the new value.  No user synchronization is possible during this time.
