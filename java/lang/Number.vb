	''' <summary>
	''' The abstract class {@code Number} is the superclass of platform
	''' classes representing numeric values that are convertible to the
	''' primitive types {@code byte}, {@code double}, {@code float}, {@code
	''' int}, {@code long}, and {@code short}.
	''' 
	''' The specific semantics of the conversion from the numeric value of
	''' a particular {@code Number} implementation to a given primitive
	''' type is defined by the {@code Number} implementation in question.
	''' 
	''' For platform classes, the conversion is often analogous to a
	''' narrowing primitive conversion or a widening primitive conversion
	''' as defining in <cite>The Java&trade; Language Specification</cite>
	''' for converting between primitive types.  Therefore, conversions may
	''' lose information about the overall magnitude of a numeric value, may
	''' lose precision, and may even return a result of a different sign
	''' than the input.
	''' 
	''' See the documentation of a given {@code Number} implementation for
	''' conversion details.
