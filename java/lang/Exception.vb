	''' The class {@code Exception} and its subclasses are a form of
	''' {@code Throwable} that indicates conditions that a reasonable
	''' application might want to catch.

	''' <p>The class {@code Exception} and any subclasses that are not also
	''' subclasses of <seealso cref="RuntimeException"/> are <em>checked
	''' exceptions</em>.  Checked exceptions need to be declared in a
	''' method or constructor's {@code throws} clause if they can be thrown
	''' by the execution of the method or constructor and propagate outside
	''' the method or constructor boundary.
