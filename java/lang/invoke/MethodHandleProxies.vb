	''' <summary>
	''' This class consists exclusively of static methods that help adapt
	''' method handles to other JVM types, such as interfaces.
	''' </summary>
	Public Class MethodHandleProxies

		Private Sub New() ' do not instantiate
		End Sub

		''' <summary>
		''' Produces an instance of the given single-method interface which redirects
		''' its calls to the given method handle.
		''' <p>
		''' A single-method interface is an interface which declares a uniquely named method.
		''' When determining the uniquely named method of a single-method interface,
		''' the public {@code Object} methods ({@code toString}, {@code equals}, {@code hashCode})
		''' are disregarded.  For example, <seealso cref="java.util.Comparator"/> is a single-method interface,
		''' even though it re-declares the {@code Object.equals} method.
		''' <p>
		''' The interface must be public.  No additional access checks are performed.
		''' <p>
		''' The resulting instance of the required type will respond to
		''' invocation of the type's uniquely named method by calling
		''' the given target on the incoming arguments,
		''' and returning or throwing whatever the target
		''' returns or throws.  The invocation will be as if by
		''' {@code target.invoke}.
		''' The target's type will be checked before the
		''' instance is created, as if by a call to {@code asType},
		''' which may result in a {@code WrongMethodTypeException}.
		''' <p>
		''' The uniquely named method is allowed to be multiply declared,
		''' with distinct type descriptors.  (E.g., it can be overloaded,
		''' or can possess bridge methods.)  All such declarations are
		''' connected directly to the target method handle.
		''' Argument and return types are adjusted by {@code asType}
		''' for each individual declaration.
		''' <p>
		''' The wrapper instance will implement the requested interface
		''' and its super-types, but no other single-method interfaces.
		''' This means that the instance will not unexpectedly
		''' pass an {@code instanceof} test for any unrequested type.
		''' <p style="font-size:smaller;">
		''' <em>Implementation Note:</em>
		''' Therefore, each instance must implement a unique single-method interface.
		''' Implementations may not bundle together
		''' multiple single-method interfaces onto single implementation classes
		''' in the style of <seealso cref="java.awt.AWTEventMulticaster"/>.
		''' <p>
		''' The method handle may throw an <em>undeclared exception</em>,
		''' which means any checked exception (or other checked throwable)
		''' not declared by the requested type's single abstract method.
		''' If this happens, the throwable will be wrapped in an instance of
		''' <seealso cref="java.lang.reflect.UndeclaredThrowableException UndeclaredThrowableException"/>
		''' and thrown in that wrapped form.
		''' <p>
		''' Like <seealso cref="java.lang.Integer#valueOf Integer.valueOf"/>,
		''' {@code asInterfaceInstance} is a factory method whose results are defined
		''' by their behavior.
		''' It is not guaranteed to return a new instance for every call.
		''' <p>
		''' Because of the possibility of <seealso cref="java.lang.reflect.Method#isBridge bridge methods"/>
		''' and other corner cases, the interface may also have several abstract methods
		''' with the same name but having distinct descriptors (types of returns and parameters).
		''' In this case, all the methods are bound in common to the one given target.
		''' The type check and effective {@code asType} conversion is applied to each
		''' method type descriptor, and all abstract methods are bound to the target in common.
		''' Beyond this type check, no further checks are made to determine that the
		''' abstract methods are related in any way.
		''' <p>
		''' Future versions of this API may accept additional types,
		''' such as abstract classes with single abstract methods.
		''' Future versions of this API may also equip wrapper instances
		''' with one or more additional public "marker" interfaces.
		''' <p>
		''' If a security manager is installed, this method is caller sensitive.
		''' During any invocation of the target method handle via the returned wrapper,
		''' the original creator of the wrapper (the caller) will be visible
		''' to context checks requested by the security manager.
		''' </summary>
		''' @param <T> the desired type of the wrapper, a single-method interface </param>
		''' <param name="intfc"> a class object representing {@code T} </param>
		''' <param name="target"> the method handle to invoke from the wrapper </param>
		''' <returns> a correctly-typed wrapper for the given target </returns>
		''' <exception cref="NullPointerException"> if either argument is null </exception>
		''' <exception cref="IllegalArgumentException"> if the {@code intfc} is not a
		'''         valid argument to this method </exception>
		''' <exception cref="WrongMethodTypeException"> if the target cannot
		'''         be converted to the type required by the requested interface </exception>
		' Other notes to implementors:
		' <p>
		' No stable mapping is promised between the single-method interface and
		' the implementation class C.  Over time, several implementation
		' classes might be used for the same type.
		' <p>
		' If the implementation is able
		' to prove that a wrapper of the required type
		' has already been created for a given
		' method handle, or for another method handle with the
		' same behavior, the implementation may return that wrapper in place of
		' a new wrapper.
		' <p>
		' This method is designed to apply to common use cases
		' where a single method handle must interoperate with
		' an interface that implements a function-like
		' API.  Additional variations, such as single-abstract-method classes with
		' private constructors, or interfaces with multiple but related
		' entry points, must be covered by hand-written or automatically
		' generated adapter classes.
