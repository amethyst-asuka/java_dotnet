	''' <summary>
	''' Serialized form of a lambda expression.  The properties of this class
	''' represent the information that is present at the lambda factory site, including
	''' static metafactory arguments such as the identity of the primary functional
	''' interface method and the identity of the implementation method, as well as
	''' dynamic metafactory arguments such as values captured from the lexical scope
	''' at the time of lambda capture.
	''' 
	''' <p>Implementors of serializable lambdas, such as compilers or language
	''' runtime libraries, are expected to ensure that instances deserialize properly.
	''' One means to do so is to ensure that the {@code writeReplace} method returns
	''' an instance of {@code SerializedLambda}, rather than allowing default
	''' serialization to proceed.
	''' 
	''' <p>{@code SerializedLambda} has a {@code readResolve} method that looks for
	''' a (possibly private) static method called
	''' {@code $deserializeLambda$(SerializedLambda)} in the capturing class, invokes
	''' that with itself as the first argument, and returns the result.  Lambda classes
	''' implementing {@code $deserializeLambda$} are responsible for validating
	''' that the properties of the {@code SerializedLambda} are consistent with a
	''' lambda actually captured by that class.
