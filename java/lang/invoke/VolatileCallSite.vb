	''' <summary>
	''' A {@code VolatileCallSite} is a <seealso cref="CallSite"/> whose target acts like a volatile variable.
	''' An {@code invokedynamic} instruction linked to a {@code VolatileCallSite} sees updates
	''' to its call site target immediately, even if the update occurs in another thread.
	''' There may be a performance penalty for such tight coupling between threads.
	''' <p>
	''' Unlike {@code MutableCallSite}, there is no
	''' <seealso cref="MutableCallSite#syncAll syncAll operation"/> on volatile
	''' call sites, since every write to a volatile variable is implicitly
	''' synchronized with reader threads.
	''' <p>
	''' In other respects, a {@code VolatileCallSite} is interchangeable
	''' with {@code MutableCallSite}. </summary>
