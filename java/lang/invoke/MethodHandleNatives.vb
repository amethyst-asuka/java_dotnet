		''' 1-N: the arguments to the method handle invocation
		''' N+1: an optional, implicitly added argument (typically the given MethodType)
		''' <p>
		''' The nominal method at such a call site is an instance of
		''' a signature-polymorphic method (see @PolymorphicSignature).
		''' Such method instances are user-visible entities which are
		''' "split" from the generic placeholder method in {@code MethodHandle}.
		''' (Note that the placeholder method is not identical with any of
		''' its instances.  If invoked reflectively, is guaranteed to throw an
		''' {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.)
		''' If the signature-polymorphic method instance is ever reified,
		''' it appears as a "copy" of the original placeholder
		''' (a native final member of {@code MethodHandle}) except
		''' that its type descriptor has shape required by the instance,
		''' and the method instance is <em>not</em> varargs.
		''' The method instance is also marked synthetic, since the
		''' method (by definition) does not appear in Java source code.
		''' <p>
		''' The JVM is allowed to reify this method as instance metadata.
		''' For example, {@code invokeBasic} is always reified.
		''' But the JVM may instead call {@code linkMethod}.
		''' If the result is an * ordered pair of a {@code (method, appendix)},
		''' the method gets all the arguments (0..N inclusive)
		''' plus the appendix (N+1), and uses the appendix to complete the call.
		''' In this way, one reusable method (called a "linker method")
		''' can perform the function of any number of polymorphic instance
		''' methods.
		''' <p>
		''' Linker methods are allowed to be weakly typed, with any or
		''' all references rewritten to {@code Object} and any primitives
		''' (except {@code long}/{@code float}/{@code double})
		''' rewritten to {@code int}.
		''' A linker method is trusted to return a strongly typed result,
		''' according to the specific method type descriptor of the
		''' signature-polymorphic instance it is emulating.
		''' This can involve (as necessary) a dynamic check using
		''' data extracted from the appendix argument.
		''' <p>
		''' The JVM does not inspect the appendix, other than to pass
		''' it verbatim to the linker method at every call.
		''' This means that the JDK runtime has wide latitude
		''' for choosing the shape of each linker method and its
		''' corresponding appendix.
		''' Linker methods should be generated from {@code LambdaForm}s
		''' so that they do not become visible on stack traces.
		''' <p>
		''' The {@code linkMethod} call is free to omit the appendix
		''' (returning null) and instead emulate the required function
		''' completely in the linker method.
		''' As a corner case, if N==255, no appendix is possible.
		''' In this case, the method returned must be custom-generated to
		''' to perform any needed type checking.
		''' <p>
		''' If the JVM does not reify a method at a call site, but instead
		''' calls {@code linkMethod}, the corresponding call represented
		''' in the bytecodes may mention a valid method which is not
		''' representable with a {@code MemberName}.
