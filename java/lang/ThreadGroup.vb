	''' <summary>
	''' A thread group represents a set of threads. In addition, a thread
	''' group can also include other thread groups. The thread groups form
	''' a tree in which every thread group except the initial thread group
	''' has a parent.
	''' <p>
	''' A thread is allowed to access information about its own thread
	''' group, but not to access information about its thread group's
	''' parent thread group or any other thread groups.

	' The locking strategy for this code is to try to lock only one level of the
	' * tree wherever possible, but otherwise to lock from the bottom up.
	' * That is, from child thread groups to parents.
	' * This has the advantage of limiting the number of locks that need to be held
	' * and in particular avoids having to grab the lock for the root thread group,
	' * (or a global lock) which would be a source of contention on a
	' * multi-processor system with many thread groups.
	' * This policy often leads to taking a snapshot of the state of a thread group
	' * and working off of that snapshot, rather than holding the thread group locked
	' * while we work on the children.
