	''' <summary>
	''' A <i>thread</i> is a thread of execution in a program. The Java
	''' Virtual Machine allows an application to have multiple threads of
	''' execution running concurrently.
	''' <p>
	''' Every thread has a priority. Threads with higher priority are
	''' executed in preference to threads with lower priority. Each thread
	''' may or may not also be marked as a daemon. When code running in
	''' some thread creates a new <code>Thread</code> object, the new
	''' thread has its priority initially set equal to the priority of the
	''' creating thread, and is a daemon thread if and only if the
	''' creating thread is a daemon.
	''' <p>
	''' When a Java Virtual Machine starts up, there is usually a single
	''' non-daemon thread (which typically calls the method named
	''' <code>main</code> of some designated class). The Java Virtual
	''' Machine continues to execute threads until either of the following
	''' occurs:
	''' <ul>
	''' <li>The <code>exit</code> method of class <code>Runtime</code> has been
	'''     called and the security manager has permitted the exit operation
	'''     to take place.
	''' <li>All threads that are not daemon threads have died, either by
	'''     returning from the call to the <code>run</code> method or by
	'''     throwing an exception that propagates beyond the <code>run</code>
	'''     method.
	''' </ul>
	''' <p>
	''' There are two ways to create a new thread of execution. One is to
	''' declare a class to be a subclass of <code>Thread</code>. This
	''' subclass should override the <code>run</code> method of class
	''' <code>Thread</code>. An instance of the subclass can then be
	''' allocated and started. For example, a thread that computes primes
	''' larger than a stated value could be written as follows:
	''' <hr><blockquote><pre>
	'''     class PrimeThread extends Thread {
	'''         long minPrime;
	'''         PrimeThread(long minPrime) {
	'''             this.minPrime = minPrime;
	'''         }
	''' 
	'''         public void run() {
	'''             // compute primes larger than minPrime
	'''             &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
	'''         }
	'''     }
	''' </pre></blockquote><hr>
	''' <p>
	''' The following code would then create a thread and start it running:
	''' <blockquote><pre>
	'''     PrimeThread p = new PrimeThread(143);
	'''     p.start();
	''' </pre></blockquote>
	''' <p>
	''' The other way to create a thread is to declare a class that
	''' implements the <code>Runnable</code> interface. That class then
	''' implements the <code>run</code> method. An instance of the class can
	''' then be allocated, passed as an argument when creating
	''' <code>Thread</code>, and started. The same example in this other
	''' style looks like the following:
	''' <hr><blockquote><pre>
	'''     class PrimeRun implements Runnable {
	'''         long minPrime;
	'''         PrimeRun(long minPrime) {
	'''             this.minPrime = minPrime;
	'''         }
	''' 
	'''         public void run() {
	'''             // compute primes larger than minPrime
	'''             &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
	'''         }
	'''     }
	''' </pre></blockquote><hr>
	''' <p>
	''' The following code would then create a thread and start it running:
	''' <blockquote><pre>
	'''     PrimeRun p = new PrimeRun(143);
	'''     new Thread(p).start();
	''' </pre></blockquote>
	''' <p>
	''' Every thread has a name for identification purposes. More than
	''' one thread may have the same name. If a name is not specified when
	''' a thread is created, a new name is generated for it.
	''' <p>
	''' Unless otherwise noted, passing a {@code null} argument to a constructor
	''' or method in this class will cause a <seealso cref="NullPointerException"/> to be
	''' thrown.
