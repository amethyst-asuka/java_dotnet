    ''' <summary>
    ''' The {@code Throwable} class is the superclass of all errors and
    ''' exceptions in the Java language. Only objects that are instances of this
    ''' class (or one of its subclasses) are thrown by the Java Virtual Machine or
    ''' can be thrown by the Java {@code throw} statement. Similarly, only
    ''' this class or one of its subclasses can be the argument type in a
    ''' {@code catch} clause.
    ''' 
    ''' For the purposes of compile-time checking of exceptions, {@code
    ''' Throwable} and any subclass of {@code Throwable} that is not also a
    ''' subclass of either <seealso cref="RuntimeException"/> or <seealso cref="Error"/> are
    ''' regarded as checked exceptions.
    ''' 
    ''' <p>Instances of two subclasses, <seealso cref="java.lang.Error"/> and
    ''' <seealso cref="java.lang.Exception"/>, are conventionally used to indicate
    ''' that exceptional situations have occurred. Typically, these instances
    ''' are freshly created in the context of the exceptional situation so
    ''' as to include relevant information (such as stack trace data).
    ''' 
    ''' <p>A throwable contains a snapshot of the execution stack of its
    ''' thread at the time it was created. It can also contain a message
    ''' string that gives more information about the error. Over time, a
    ''' throwable can <seealso cref="Throwable#addSuppressed suppress"/> other
    ''' throwables from being propagated.  Finally, the throwable can also
    ''' contain a <i>cause</i>: another throwable that caused this
    ''' throwable to be constructed.  The recording of this causal information
    ''' is referred to as the <i>chained exception</i> facility, as the
    ''' cause can, itself, have a cause, and so on, leading to a "chain" of
    ''' exceptions, each caused by another.
    ''' 
    ''' <p>One reason that a throwable may have a cause is that the class that
    ''' throws it is built atop a lower layered abstraction, and an operation on
    ''' the upper layer fails due to a failure in the lower layer.  It would be bad
    ''' design to let the throwable thrown by the lower layer propagate outward, as
    ''' it is generally unrelated to the abstraction provided by the upper layer.
    ''' Further, doing so would tie the API of the upper layer to the details of
    ''' its implementation, assuming the lower layer's exception was a checked
    ''' exception.  Throwing a "wrapped exception" (i.e., an exception containing a
    ''' cause) allows the upper layer to communicate the details of the failure to
    ''' its caller without incurring either of these shortcomings.  It preserves
    ''' the flexibility to change the implementation of the upper layer without
    ''' changing its API (in particular, the set of exceptions thrown by its
    ''' methods).
    ''' 
    ''' <p>A second reason that a throwable may have a cause is that the method
    ''' that throws it must conform to a general-purpose interface that does not
    ''' permit the method to throw the cause directly.  For example, suppose
    ''' a persistent collection conforms to the {@link java.util.Collection
    ''' Collection} interface, and that its persistence is implemented atop
    ''' {@code java.io}.  Suppose the internals of the {@code add} method
    ''' can throw an <seealso cref="java.io.IOException IOException"/>.  The implementation
    ''' can communicate the details of the {@code IOException} to its caller
    ''' while conforming to the {@code Collection} interface by wrapping the
    ''' {@code IOException} in an appropriate unchecked exception.  (The
    ''' specification for the persistent collection should indicate that it is
    ''' capable of throwing such exceptions.)
    ''' 
    ''' <p>A cause can be associated with a throwable in two ways: via a
    ''' constructor that takes the cause as an argument, or via the
    ''' <seealso cref="#initCause(Throwable)"/> method.  New throwable classes that
    ''' wish to allow causes to be associated with them should provide constructors
    ''' that take a cause and delegate (perhaps indirectly) to one of the
    ''' {@code Throwable} constructors that takes a cause.
    ''' 
    ''' Because the {@code initCause} method is public, it allows a cause to be
    ''' associated with any throwable, even a "legacy throwable" whose
    ''' implementation predates the addition of the exception chaining mechanism to
    ''' {@code Throwable}.
    ''' 
    ''' <p>By convention, class {@code Throwable} and its subclasses have two
    ''' constructors, one that takes no arguments and one that takes a
    ''' {@code String} argument that can be used to produce a detail message.
    ''' Further, those subclasses that might likely have a cause associated with
    ''' them should have two more constructors, one that takes a
    ''' {@code Throwable} (the cause), and one that takes a
    ''' {@code String} (the detail message) and a {@code Throwable} (the
    ''' cause).

        ''' exceptions can be thrown in sibling code blocks, in particular
        ''' in the {@code try} block of a {@code try}-with-resources
