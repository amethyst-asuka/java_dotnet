	''' <summary>
	''' The AccessibleObject class is the base class for Field, Method and
	''' Constructor objects.  It provides the ability to flag a reflected
	''' object as suppressing default Java language access control checks
	''' when it is used.  The access checks--for public, default (package)
	''' access, protected, and private members--are performed when Fields,
	''' Methods or Constructors are used to set or get fields, to invoke
	''' methods, or to create and initialize new instances of classes,
	''' respectively.
	''' 
	''' <p>Setting the {@code accessible} flag in a reflected object
	''' permits sophisticated applications with sufficient privilege, such
	''' as Java Object Serialization or other persistence mechanisms, to
	''' manipulate objects in a manner that would normally be prohibited.
	''' 
	''' <p>By default, a reflected object is <em>not</em> accessible.

		' Shared access checking logic.

		' For non-public members or members in package-private classes,

		' If the security check succeeds for a given [Class], it will
		' always succeed (it is not affected by the granting or revoking
		' of permissions); we speed up the check in the common case by
		' remembering the last Class for which the check succeeded.
		'
		' The simple security check for Constructor is to see if
		' the caller has already been seen, verified, and cached.
		' (See also Class.newInstance(), which uses a similar method.)
		'
		' A more complicated security check cache is needed for Method and Field
		' The cache can be either null (empty cache), a 2-array of {caller,target},
		' or a caller (with target implicitly equal to this.clazz).
