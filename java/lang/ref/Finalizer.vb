	'       The former method invokes all pending finalizers, while the latter
	'       invokes all uninvoked finalizers if on-exit finalization has been
	'       enabled.
	'
	'       These two methods could have been implemented by offloading their work
	'       to the regular finalizer thread and waiting for that thread to finish.
	'       The advantage of creating a fresh thread, however, is that it insulates
	'       invokers of these methods from a stalled or deadlocked finalizer thread.
