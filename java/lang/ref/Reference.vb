	''' Abstract base class for reference objects.  This class defines the

	Public MustInherit Class Reference(Of T)

	'     A Reference instance is in one of four possible internal states:
	'     *
	'     *     Active: Subject to special treatment by the garbage collector.  Some
	'     *     time after the collector detects that the reachability of the
	'     *     referent has changed to the appropriate state, it changes the
	'     *     instance's state to either Pending or Inactive, depending upon
	'     *     whether or not the instance was registered with a queue when it was
	'     *     created.  In the former case it also adds the instance to the
	'     *     pending-Reference list.  Newly-created instances are Active.
	'     *
	'     *     Pending: An element of the pending-Reference list, waiting to be
	'     *     enqueued by the Reference-handler thread.  Unregistered instances
	'     *     are never in this state.
	'     *
	'     *     Enqueued: An element of the queue with which the instance was
	'     *     registered when it was created.  When an instance is removed from
	'     *     its ReferenceQueue, it is made Inactive.  Unregistered instances are
	'     *     never in this state.
	'     *
	'     *     Inactive: Nothing more to do.  Once an instance becomes Inactive its
	'     *     state will never change again.
	'     *
	'     * The state is encoded in the queue and next fields as follows:
	'     *
	'     *     Active: queue = ReferenceQueue with which instance is registered, or
	'     *     ReferenceQueue.NULL if it was not registered with a queue; next =
	'     *     null.
	'     *
	'     *     Pending: queue = ReferenceQueue with which instance is registered;
	'     *     next = this
	'     *
	'     *     Enqueued: queue = ReferenceQueue.ENQUEUED; next = Following instance
	'     *     in queue, or this if at end of list.
	'     *
	'     *     Inactive: queue = ReferenceQueue.NULL; next = this.
	'     *
	'     * With this scheme the collector need only examine the next field in order
	'     * to determine whether a Reference instance requires special treatment: If
	'     * the next field is null then the instance is active; if it is non-null,
	'     * then the collector should treat the instance normally.
	'     *
	'     * To ensure that a concurrent collector can discover active Reference
	'     * objects without interfering with application threads that may apply
	'     * the enqueue() method to those objects, collectors should link
	'     * discovered objects through the discovered field. The discovered
	'     * field is also used for linking Reference objects in the pending list.
	'
