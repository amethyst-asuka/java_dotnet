	''' <summary>
	''' <P>The basic service for managing a set of JDBC drivers.<br>
	''' <B>NOTE:</B> The <seealso cref="javax.sql.DataSource"/> interface, new in the
	''' JDBC 2.0 API, provides another way to connect to a data source.
	''' The use of a <code>DataSource</code> object is the preferred means of
	''' connecting to a data source.
	''' 
	''' <P>As part of its initialization, the <code>DriverManager</code> class will
	''' attempt to load the driver classes referenced in the "jdbc.drivers"
	''' system property. This allows a user to customize the JDBC Drivers
	''' used by their applications. For example in your
	''' ~/.hotjava/properties file you might specify:
	''' <pre>
	''' <CODE>jdbc.drivers=foo.bah.Driver:wombat.sql.Driver:bad.taste.ourDriver</CODE>
	''' </pre>
	''' <P> The <code>DriverManager</code> methods <code>getConnection</code> and
	''' <code>getDrivers</code> have been enhanced to support the Java Standard Edition
	''' <a href="../../../technotes/guides/jar/jar.html#Service%20Provider">Service Provider</a> mechanism. JDBC 4.0 Drivers must
	''' include the file <code>META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver</code>. This file contains the name of the JDBC drivers
	''' implementation of <code>java.sql.Driver</code>.  For example, to load the <code>my.sql.Driver</code> [Class],
	''' the <code>META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver</code> file would contain the entry:
	''' <pre>
	''' <code>my.sql.Driver</code>
	''' </pre>
	''' 
	''' <P>Applications no longer need to explicitly load JDBC drivers using <code>Class.forName()</code>. Existing programs
	''' which currently load JDBC drivers using <code>Class.forName()</code> will continue to work without
	''' modification.
	''' 
	''' <P>When the method <code>getConnection</code> is called,
	''' the <code>DriverManager</code> will attempt to
	''' locate a suitable driver from amongst those loaded at
	''' initialization and those loaded explicitly using the same classloader
	''' as the current applet or application.
	''' 
	''' <P>
	''' Starting with the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, version 1.3, a
	''' logging stream can be set only if the proper
	''' permission has been granted.  Normally this will be done with
	''' the tool PolicyTool, which can be used to grant <code>permission
	''' java.sql.SQLPermission "setLog"</code>. </summary>
