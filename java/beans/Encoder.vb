	''' <summary>
	''' An <code>Encoder</code> is a class which can be used to create
	''' files or streams that encode the state of a collection of
	''' JavaBeans in terms of their public APIs. The <code>Encoder</code>,
	''' in conjunction with its persistence delegates, is responsible for
	''' breaking the object graph down into a series of <code>Statements</code>s
	''' and <code>Expression</code>s which can be used to create it.
	''' A subclass typically provides a syntax for these expressions
	''' using some human readable form - like Java source code or XML.

		''' <summary>
		''' Returns the persistence delegate for the given type.
		''' The persistence delegate is calculated by applying
		''' the following rules in order:
		''' <ol>
		''' <li>
		''' If a persistence delegate is associated with the given type
		''' by using the <seealso cref="#setPersistenceDelegate"/> method
		''' it is returned.
		''' <li>
		''' A persistence delegate is then looked up by the name
		''' composed of the the fully qualified name of the given type
		''' and the "PersistenceDelegate" postfix.
		''' For example, a persistence delegate for the {@code Bean} class
		''' should be named {@code BeanPersistenceDelegate}
		''' and located in the same package.
		''' <pre>
		''' public class Bean { ... }
		''' public class BeanPersistenceDelegate { ... }</pre>
		''' The instance of the {@code BeanPersistenceDelegate} class
		''' is returned for the {@code Bean} class.
		''' <li>
		''' If the type is {@code null},
		''' a shared internal persistence delegate is returned
		''' that encodes {@code null} value.
		''' <li>
		''' If the type is a {@code enum} declaration,
		''' a shared internal persistence delegate is returned
		''' that encodes constants of this enumeration
		''' by their names.
		''' <li>
		''' If the type is a primitive type or the corresponding wrapper,
		''' a shared internal persistence delegate is returned
		''' that encodes values of the given type.
		''' <li>
		''' If the type is an array,
		''' a shared internal persistence delegate is returned
		''' that encodes an array of the appropriate type and length,
		''' and each of its elements as if they are properties.
		''' <li>
		''' If the type is a proxy,
		''' a shared internal persistence delegate is returned
		''' that encodes a proxy instance by using
		''' the <seealso cref="java.lang.reflect.Proxy#newProxyInstance"/> method.
		''' <li>
		''' If the <seealso cref="BeanInfo"/> for this type has a <seealso cref="BeanDescriptor"/>
		''' which defined a "persistenceDelegate" attribute,
		''' the value of this named attribute is returned.
		''' <li>
		''' In all other cases the default persistence delegate is returned.
		''' The default persistence delegate assumes the type is a <em>JavaBean</em>,
		''' implying that it has a default constructor and that its state
		''' may be characterized by the matching pairs of "setter" and "getter"
		''' methods returned by the <seealso cref="Introspector"/> class.
		''' The default constructor is the constructor with the greatest number
		''' of parameters that has the <seealso cref="ConstructorProperties"/> annotation.
		''' If none of the constructors has the {@code ConstructorProperties} annotation,
		''' then the nullary constructor (constructor with no parameters) will be used.
		''' For example, in the following code fragment, the nullary constructor
		''' for the {@code Foo} class will be used,
		''' while the two-parameter constructor
		''' for the {@code Bar} class will be used.
		''' <pre>
		''' public class Foo {
		'''     public Foo() { ... }
		'''     public Foo(int x) { ... }
		''' }
		''' public class Bar {
		'''     public Bar() { ... }
