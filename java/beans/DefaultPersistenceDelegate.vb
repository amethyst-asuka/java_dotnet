	''' <summary>
	''' The <code>DefaultPersistenceDelegate</code> is a concrete implementation of
	''' the abstract <code>PersistenceDelegate</code> class and
	''' is the delegate used by default for classes about
	''' which no information is available. The <code>DefaultPersistenceDelegate</code>
	''' provides, version resilient, public API-based persistence for
	''' classes that follow the JavaBeans&trade; conventions without any class specific
	''' configuration.
	''' <p>
	''' The key assumptions are that the class has a nullary constructor
	''' and that its state is accurately represented by matching pairs
	''' of "setter" and "getter" methods in the order they are returned
	''' by the Introspector.
	''' In addition to providing code-free persistence for JavaBeans,
	''' the <code>DefaultPersistenceDelegate</code> provides a convenient means
	''' to effect persistent storage for classes that have a constructor
	''' that, while not nullary, simply requires some property values
	''' as arguments.

			' Listeners
	'        
	'        Pending(milne). There is a general problem with the archival of
	'        listeners which is unresolved as of 1.4. Many of the methods
	'        which install one object inside another (typically "add" methods
	'        or setters) automatically install a listener on the "child" object
	'        so that its "parent" may respond to changes that are made to it.
	'        For example the JTable:setModel() method automatically adds a
	'        TableModelListener (the JTable itself in this case) to the supplied
	'        table model.
	'
	'        We do not need to explicitly add these listeners to the model in an
	'        archive as they will be added automatically by, in the above case,
	'        the JTable's "setModel" method. In some cases, we must specifically
	'        avoid trying to do this since the listener may be an inner class
	'        that cannot be instantiated using public API.
	'
	'        No general mechanism currently
	'        exists for differentiating between these kind of listeners and
	'        those which were added explicitly by the user. A mechanism must
	'        be created to provide a general means to differentiate these
	'        special cases so as to provide reliable persistence of listeners
	'        for the general case.

		''' <summary>
		''' This default implementation of the <code>initialize</code> method assumes
		''' all state held in objects of this type is exposed via the
		''' matching pairs of "setter" and "getter" methods in the order
		''' they are returned by the Introspector. If a property descriptor
		''' defines a "transient" attribute with a value equal to
		''' <code>Boolean.TRUE</code> the property is ignored by this
		''' default implementation. Note that this use of the word
		''' "transient" is quite independent of the field modifier
		''' that is used by the <code>ObjectOutputStream</code>.
		''' <p>
		''' For each non-transient property, an expression is created
		''' in which the nullary "getter" method is applied
		''' to the <code>oldInstance</code>. The value of this
		''' expression is the value of the property in the instance that is
		''' being serialized. If the value of this expression
		''' in the cloned environment <code>mutatesTo</code> the
		''' target value, the new value is initialized to make it
		''' equivalent to the old value. In this case, because
		''' the property value has not changed there is no need to
		''' call the corresponding "setter" method and no statement
		''' is emitted. If not however, the expression for this value
		''' is replaced with another expression (normally a constructor)
		''' and the corresponding "setter" method is called to install
		''' the new property value in the object. This scheme removes
		''' default information from the output produced by streams
		''' using this delegate.
		''' <p>
		''' In passing these statements to the output stream, where they
		''' will be executed, side effects are made to the <code>newInstance</code>.
		''' In most cases this allows the problem of properties
		''' whose values depend on each other to actually help the
		''' serialization process by making the number of statements
		''' that need to be written to the output smaller. In general,
		''' the problem of handling interdependent properties is reduced to
		''' that of finding an order for the properties in
		''' a class such that no property value depends on the value of
		''' a subsequent property.
