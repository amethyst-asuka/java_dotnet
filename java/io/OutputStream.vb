	''' <summary>
	''' This abstract class is the superclass of all classes representing
	''' an output stream of bytes. An output stream accepts output bytes
	''' and sends them to some sink.
	''' <p>
	''' Applications that need to define a subclass of
	''' <code>OutputStream</code> must always provide at least a method
	''' that writes one byte of output.

		''' <summary>
		''' Writes the specified byte to this output stream. The general
		''' contract for <code>write</code> is that one byte is written
		''' to the output stream. The byte to be written is the eight
		''' low-order bits of the argument <code>b</code>. The 24
		''' high-order bits of <code>b</code> are ignored.
		''' <p>
		''' Subclasses of <code>OutputStream</code> must provide an

		''' <summary>
		''' Writes <code>b.length</code> bytes from the specified byte array
		''' to this output stream. The general contract for <code>write(b)</code>

		''' <summary>
		''' Writes <code>len</code> bytes from the specified byte array
		''' starting at offset <code>off</code> to this output stream.
		''' The general contract for <code>write(b, off, len)</code> is that
		''' some of the bytes in the array <code>b</code> are written to the
		''' output stream in order; element <code>b[off]</code> is the first
		''' byte written and <code>b[off+len-1]</code> is the last byte written
		''' by this operation.
		''' <p>
		''' The <code>write</code> method of <code>OutputStream</code> calls
		''' the write method of one argument on each of the bytes to be
		''' written out. Subclasses are encouraged to override this method and
		''' provide a more efficient implementation.
		''' <p>
		''' If <code>b</code> is <code>null</code>, a
		''' <code>NullPointerException</code> is thrown.
		''' <p>
		''' If <code>off</code> is negative, or <code>len</code> is negative, or
		''' <code>off+len</code> is greater than the length of the array
		''' <code>b</code>, then an <tt>IndexOutOfBoundsException</tt> is thrown.

		''' <summary>
		''' Flushes this output stream and forces any buffered output bytes
		''' to be written out. The general contract of <code>flush</code> is
		''' that calling it is an indication that, if any bytes previously
		''' written have been buffered by the implementation of the output
		''' stream, such bytes should immediately be written to their
		''' intended destination.
		''' <p>
		''' If the intended destination of this stream is an abstraction provided by
		''' the underlying operating system, for example a file, then flushing the
		''' stream guarantees only that bytes previously written to the stream are
		''' passed to the operating system for writing; it does not guarantee that
		''' they are actually written to a physical device such as a disk drive.

		''' <summary>
		''' Closes this output stream and releases any system resources
		''' associated with this stream. The general contract of <code>close</code>
		''' is that it closes the output stream. A closed stream cannot perform
		''' output operations and cannot be reopened.
