	''' <summary>
	''' The {@code StreamTokenizer} class takes an input stream and
	''' parses it into "tokens", allowing the tokens to be
	''' read one at a time. The parsing process is controlled by a table
	''' and a number of flags that can be set to various states. The
	''' stream tokenizer can recognize identifiers, numbers, quoted
	''' strings, and various comment styles.
	''' <p>
	''' Each byte read from the input stream is regarded as a character
	''' in the range {@code '\u005Cu0000'} through {@code '\u005Cu00FF'}.
	''' The character value is used to look up five possible attributes of
	''' the character: <i>white space</i>, <i>alphabetic</i>,
	''' <i>numeric</i>, <i>string quote</i>, and <i>comment character</i>.
	''' Each character can have zero or more of these attributes.
	''' <p>
	''' In addition, an instance has four flags. These flags indicate:
	''' <ul>
	''' <li>Whether line terminators are to be returned as tokens or treated
	'''     as white space that merely separates tokens.
	''' <li>Whether C-style comments are to be recognized and skipped.
	''' <li>Whether C++-style comments are to be recognized and skipped.
	''' <li>Whether the characters of identifiers are converted to lowercase.
	''' </ul>
	''' <p>
	''' A typical application first constructs an instance of this [Class],
	''' sets up the syntax tables, and then repeatedly loops calling the
	''' {@code nextToken} method in each iteration of the loop until
	''' it returns the value {@code TT_EOF}.
