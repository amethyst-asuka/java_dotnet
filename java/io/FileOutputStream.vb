	''' <summary>
	''' A file output stream is an output stream for writing data to a
	''' <code>File</code> or to a <code>FileDescriptor</code>. Whether or not
	''' a file is available or may be created depends upon the underlying
	''' platform.  Some platforms, in particular, allow a file to be opened
	''' for writing by only one <tt>FileOutputStream</tt> (or other
	''' file-writing object) at a time.  In such situations the constructors in
	''' this class will fail if the file involved is already open.
	''' 
	''' <p><code>FileOutputStream</code> is meant for writing streams of raw bytes
	''' such as image data. For writing streams of characters, consider using
	''' <code>FileWriter</code>.
