	''' <summary>
	''' A piped output stream can be connected to a piped input stream
	''' to create a communications pipe. The piped output stream is the
	''' sending end of the pipe. Typically, data is written to a
	''' <code>PipedOutputStream</code> object by one thread and data is
	''' read from the connected <code>PipedInputStream</code> by some
	''' other thread. Attempting to use both objects from a single thread
	''' is not recommended as it may deadlock the thread.
	''' The pipe is said to be <a name=BROKEN> <i>broken</i> </a> if a
	''' thread that was reading data bytes from the connected piped input
	''' stream is no longer alive.
