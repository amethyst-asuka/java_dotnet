	''' <summary>
	''' A <code>PushbackInputStream</code> adds
	''' functionality to another input stream, namely
	''' the  ability to "push back" or "unread"
	''' one byte. This is useful in situations where
	''' it is  convenient for a fragment of code
	''' to read an indefinite number of data bytes
	''' that  are delimited by a particular byte
	''' value; after reading the terminating byte,
	''' the  code fragment can "unread" it, so that
	''' the next read operation on the input stream
	''' will reread the byte that was pushed back.
	''' For example, bytes representing the  characters
	''' constituting an identifier might be terminated
	''' by a byte representing an  operator character;
	''' a method whose job is to read just an identifier
	''' can read until it  sees the operator and
	''' then push the operator back to be re-read.
