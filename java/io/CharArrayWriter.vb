	''' <summary>
	''' This class implements a character buffer that can be used as an Writer.
	''' The buffer automatically grows when data is written to the stream.  The data
	''' can be retrieved using toCharArray() and toString().
	''' <P>
	''' Note: Invoking close() on this class has no effect, and methods
	''' of this class can be called after the stream has closed
	''' without generating an IOException.
