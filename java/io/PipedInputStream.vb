    ''' A piped input stream should be connected
    ''' to a piped output stream; the piped  input
    ''' stream then provides whatever data bytes
    ''' are written to the piped output  stream.
    ''' Typically, data is read from a <code>PipedInputStream</code>
    ''' object by one thread  and data is written
    ''' to the corresponding <code>PipedOutputStream</code>
    ''' by some  other thread. Attempting to use
    ''' both objects from a single thread is not
    ''' recommended, as it may deadlock the thread.
    ''' The piped input stream contains a buffer,
    ''' decoupling read operations from write operations,
    ''' within limits.
    ''' A pipe is said to be <a name="BROKEN"> <i>broken</i> </a> if a
    ''' thread that was providing data bytes to the connected
    ''' piped output stream is no longer alive.
