	''' <summary>
	''' Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a
	''' random access file. A random access file behaves like a large
	''' array of bytes stored in the file system. There is a kind of cursor,
	''' or index into the implied array, called the <em>file pointer</em>;
	''' input operations read bytes starting at the file pointer and advance
	''' the file pointer past the bytes read. If the random access file is
	''' created in read/write mode, then output operations are also available;
	''' output operations write bytes starting at the file pointer and advance
	''' the file pointer past the bytes written. Output operations that write
	''' past the current end of the implied array cause the array to be
	''' extended. The file pointer can be read by the
	''' {@code getFilePointer} method and set by the {@code seek}
	''' method.
	''' <p>
	''' It is generally true of all the reading routines in this class that
	''' if end-of-file is reached before the desired number of bytes has been
	''' read, an {@code EOFException} (which is a kind of
	''' {@code IOException}) is thrown. If any byte cannot be read for
	''' any reason other than end-of-file, an {@code IOException} other
	''' than {@code EOFException} is thrown. In particular, an
	''' {@code IOException} may be thrown if the stream has been closed.
