	''' <summary>
	''' Convenience class for reading character files.  The constructors of this
	''' class assume that the default character encoding and the default byte-buffer
	''' size are appropriate.  To specify these values yourself, construct an
	''' InputStreamReader on a FileInputStream.
	''' 
	''' <p><code>FileReader</code> is meant for reading streams of characters.
	''' For reading streams of raw bytes, consider using a
	''' <code>FileInputStream</code>.
