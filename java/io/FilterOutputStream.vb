    ''' <summary>
    ''' This class is the superclass of all classes that filter output
    ''' streams. These streams sit on top of an already existing output
    ''' stream (the <i>underlying</i> output stream) which it uses as its
    ''' basic sink of data, but possibly transforming the data along the
    ''' way or providing additional functionality.
    ''' <p>
    ''' The class <code>FilterOutputStream</code> itself simply overrides
    ''' all methods of <code>OutputStream</code> with versions that pass
    ''' all requests to the underlying output stream. Subclasses of
    ''' <code>FilterOutputStream</code> may further override some of these
    ''' methods as well as provide additional methods and fields.
