	''' <summary>
	''' A <code>BufferedInputStream</code> adds
	''' functionality to another input stream-namely,
	''' the ability to buffer the input and to
	''' support the <code>mark</code> and <code>reset</code>
	''' methods. When  the <code>BufferedInputStream</code>
	''' is created, an internal buffer array is
	''' created. As bytes  from the stream are read
	''' or skipped, the internal buffer is refilled
	''' as necessary  from the contained input stream,
	''' many bytes at a time. The <code>mark</code>
	''' operation  remembers a point in the input
	''' stream and the <code>reset</code> operation
	''' causes all the  bytes read since the most
	''' recent <code>mark</code> operation to be
	''' reread before new bytes are  taken from
	''' the contained input stream.
