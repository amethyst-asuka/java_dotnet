	''' <summary>
	''' This class allows an application to create an input stream in
	''' which the bytes read are supplied by the contents of a string.
	''' Applications can also read bytes from a byte array by using a
	''' <code>ByteArrayInputStream</code>.
	''' <p>
	''' Only the low eight bits of each character in the string are used by
	''' this class.
