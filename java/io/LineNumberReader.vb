	''' <summary>
	''' A buffered character-input stream that keeps track of line numbers.  This
	''' class defines methods <seealso cref="#setLineNumber(int)"/> and {@link
	''' #getLineNumber()} for setting and getting the current line number
	''' respectively.
	''' 
	''' <p> By default, line numbering begins at 0. This number increments at every
	''' <a href="#lt">line terminator</a> as the data is read, and can be changed
	''' with a call to <tt>setLineNumber(int)</tt>.  Note however, that
	''' <tt>setLineNumber(int)</tt> does not actually change the current position in
	''' the stream; it only changes the value that will be returned by
	''' <tt>getLineNumber()</tt>.
	''' 
	''' <p> A line is considered to be <a name="lt">terminated</a> by any one of a
	''' line feed ('\n'), a carriage return ('\r'), or a carriage return followed
	''' immediately by a linefeed.
