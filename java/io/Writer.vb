	''' <summary>
	''' Abstract class for writing to character streams.  The only methods that a
	''' subclass must implement are write(char[], int, int), flush(), and close().
	''' Most subclasses, however, will override some of the methods defined here in
	''' order to provide higher efficiency, additional functionality, or both.
