	''' <summary>
	''' Utility class for normalizing and merging patterns for collation.
	''' Patterns are strings of the form <entry>*, where <entry> has the
	''' form:
	''' <pattern> := <entry>*
	''' <entry> := <separator><chars>{"/"<extension>}
	''' <separator> := "=", ",", ";", "<", "&"
	''' <chars>, and <extension> are both arbitrary strings.
	''' unquoted whitespaces are ignored.
	''' 'xxx' can be used to quote characters
	''' One difference from Collator is that & is used to reset to a current
	''' point. Or, in other words, it introduces a new sequence which is to
	''' be added to the old.
	''' That is: "a < b < c < d" is the same as "a < b & b < c & c < d" OR
	''' "a < b < d & b < c"
	''' XXX: make '' be a single quote. </summary>
	''' <seealso cref= PatternEntry
