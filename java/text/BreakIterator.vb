	''' <summary>
	''' The <code>BreakIterator</code> class implements methods for finding
	''' the location of boundaries in text. Instances of <code>BreakIterator</code>
	''' maintain a current position and scan over text
	''' returning the index of characters where boundaries occur.
	''' Internally, <code>BreakIterator</code> scans text using a
	''' <code>CharacterIterator</code>, and is thus able to scan text held
	''' by any object implementing that protocol. A <code>StringCharacterIterator</code>
	''' is used to scan <code>String</code> objects passed to <code>setText</code>.
	''' 
	''' <p>
	''' You use the factory methods provided by this class to create
	''' instances of various types of break iterators. In particular,
	''' use <code>getWordInstance</code>, <code>getLineInstance</code>,
	''' <code>getSentenceInstance</code>, and <code>getCharacterInstance</code>
	''' to create <code>BreakIterator</code>s that perform
	''' word, line, sentence, and character boundary analysis respectively.
	''' A single <code>BreakIterator</code> can work only on one unit
	''' (word, line, sentence, and so on). You must use a different iterator
	''' for each unit boundary analysis you wish to perform.
	''' 
	''' <p><a name="line"></a>
	''' Line boundary analysis determines where a text string can be
	''' broken when line-wrapping. The mechanism correctly handles
	''' punctuation and hyphenated words. Actual line breaking needs
	''' to also consider the available line width and is handled by
	''' higher-level software.
	''' 
	''' <p><a name="sentence"></a>
	''' Sentence boundary analysis allows selection with correct interpretation
	''' of periods within numbers and abbreviations, and trailing punctuation
	''' marks such as quotation marks and parentheses.
	''' 
	''' <p><a name="word"></a>
	''' Word boundary analysis is used by search and replace functions, as
	''' well as within text editing applications that allow the user to
	''' select words with a double click. Word selection provides correct
	''' interpretation of punctuation marks within and following
	''' words. Characters that are not part of a word, such as symbols
	''' or punctuation marks, have word-breaks on both sides.
	''' 
	''' <p><a name="character"></a>
	''' Character boundary analysis allows users to interact with characters
	''' as they expect to, for example, when moving the cursor through a text
	''' string. Character boundary analysis provides correct navigation
	''' through character strings, regardless of how the character is stored.
	''' The boundaries returned may be those of supplementary characters,
	''' combining character sequences, or ligature clusters.
	''' For example, an accented character might be stored as a base character
	''' and a diacritical mark. What users consider to be a character can
	''' differ between languages.
	''' 
	''' <p>
	''' The <code>BreakIterator</code> instances returned by the factory methods
	''' of this class are intended for use with natural languages only, not for
	''' programming language text. It is however possible to define subclasses
	''' that tokenize a programming language.
	''' 
	''' <P>
	''' <strong>Examples</strong>:<P>
	''' Creating and using text boundaries:
	''' <blockquote>
	''' <pre>
	''' Public Shared  Sub  main(String args[]) {
	'''      if (args.length == 1) {
	'''          String stringToExamine = args[0];
	'''          //print each word in order
	'''          BreakIterator boundary = BreakIterator.getWordInstance();
	'''          boundary.setText(stringToExamine);
	'''          printEachForward(boundary, stringToExamine);
	'''          //print each sentence in reverse order
	'''          boundary = BreakIterator.getSentenceInstance(Locale.US);
	'''          boundary.setText(stringToExamine);
	'''          printEachBackward(boundary, stringToExamine);
	'''          printFirst(boundary, stringToExamine);
	'''          printLast(boundary, stringToExamine);
	'''      }
	''' }
	''' </pre>
	''' </blockquote>
	''' 
	''' Print each element in order:
	''' <blockquote>
	''' <pre>
	''' Public Shared  Sub  printEachForward(BreakIterator boundary, String source) {
	'''     int start = boundary.first();
	'''     for (int end = boundary.next();
	'''          end != BreakIterator.DONE;
	'''          start = end, end = boundary.next()) {
	'''          System.out.println(source.substring(start,end));
	'''     }
	''' }
	''' </pre>
	''' </blockquote>
	''' 
	''' Print each element in reverse order:
	''' <blockquote>
	''' <pre>
	''' Public Shared  Sub  printEachBackward(BreakIterator boundary, String source) {
	'''     int end = boundary.last();
	'''     for (int start = boundary.previous();
	'''          start != BreakIterator.DONE;
	'''          end = start, start = boundary.previous()) {
	'''         System.out.println(source.substring(start,end));
	'''     }
	''' }
	''' </pre>
	''' </blockquote>
	''' 
	''' Print first element:
	''' <blockquote>
	''' <pre>
	''' Public Shared  Sub  printFirst(BreakIterator boundary, String source) {
	'''     int start = boundary.first();
	'''     int end = boundary.next();
	'''     System.out.println(source.substring(start,end));
	''' }
	''' </pre>
	''' </blockquote>
	''' 
	''' Print last element:
	''' <blockquote>
	''' <pre>
	''' Public Shared  Sub  printLast(BreakIterator boundary, String source) {
	'''     int end = boundary.last();
	'''     int start = boundary.previous();
	'''     System.out.println(source.substring(start,end));
	''' }
	''' </pre>
	''' </blockquote>
	''' 
	''' Print the element at a specified position:
	''' <blockquote>
	''' <pre>
	''' Public Shared  Sub  printAt(BreakIterator boundary, int pos, String source) {
	'''     int end = boundary.following(pos);
	'''     int start = boundary.previous();
	'''     System.out.println(source.substring(start,end));
	''' }
	''' </pre>
	''' </blockquote>
	''' 
	''' Find the next word:
	''' <blockquote>
	''' <pre>{@code
	''' Public Shared int nextWordStartAfter(int pos, String text) {
	'''     BreakIterator wb = BreakIterator.getWordInstance();
	'''     wb.setText(text);
	'''     int last = wb.following(pos);
	'''     int current = wb.next();
	'''     while (current != BreakIterator.DONE) {
	'''         for (int p = last; p < current; p++) {
	'''             if (Character.isLetter(text.codePointAt(p)))
	'''                 return last;
	'''         }
	'''         last = current;
	'''         current = wb.next();
	'''     }
	'''     return BreakIterator.DONE;
	''' }
	''' }</pre>
	''' (The iterator returned by BreakIterator.getWordInstance() is unique in that
	''' the break positions it returns don't represent both the start and end of the
	''' thing being iterated over.  That is, a sentence-break iterator returns breaks
	''' that each represent the end of one sentence and the beginning of the next.
	''' With the word-break iterator, the characters between two boundaries might be a
	''' word, or they might be the punctuation or whitespace between two words.  The
	''' above code uses a simple heuristic to determine which boundary is the beginning
	''' of a word: If the characters between this boundary and the next boundary
	''' include at least one letter (this can be an alphabetical letter, a CJK ideograph,
	''' a Hangul syllable, a Kana character, etc.), then the text between this boundary
	''' and the next is a word; otherwise, it's the material between words.)
