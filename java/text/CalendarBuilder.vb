	''' <summary>
	''' {@code CalendarBuilder} keeps field-value pairs for setting
	''' the calendar fields of the given {@code Calendar}. It has the
	''' <seealso cref="Calendar#FIELD_COUNT FIELD_COUNT"/>-th field for the week year
	''' support. Also {@code ISO_DAY_OF_WEEK} is used to specify
	''' {@code DAY_OF_WEEK} in the ISO day of week numbering.
	''' 
	''' <p>{@code CalendarBuilder} retains the semantic of the pseudo
	''' timestamp for fields. {@code CalendarBuilder} uses a single
	''' int array combining fields[] and stamp[] of {@code Calendar}.
