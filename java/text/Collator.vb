	''' <summary>
	''' The <code>Collator</code> class performs locale-sensitive
	''' <code>String</code> comparison. You use this class to build
	''' searching and sorting routines for natural language text.
	''' 
	''' <p>
	''' <code>Collator</code> is an abstract base class. Subclasses
	''' implement specific collation strategies. One subclass,
	''' <code>RuleBasedCollator</code>, is currently provided with
	''' the Java Platform and is applicable to a wide set of languages. Other
	''' subclasses may be created to handle more specialized needs.
	''' 
	''' <p>
	''' Like other locale-sensitive classes, you can use the static
	''' factory method, <code>getInstance</code>, to obtain the appropriate
	''' <code>Collator</code> object for a given locale. You will only need
	''' to look at the subclasses of <code>Collator</code> if you need
	''' to understand the details of a particular collation strategy or
	''' if you need to modify that strategy.
	''' 
	''' <p>
	''' The following example shows how to compare two strings using
	''' the <code>Collator</code> for the default locale.
	''' <blockquote>
	''' <pre>{@code
	''' // Compare two strings in the default locale
	''' Collator myCollator = Collator.getInstance();
	''' if( myCollator.compare("abc", "ABC") < 0 )
	'''     System.out.println("abc is less than ABC");
	''' else
	'''     System.out.println("abc is greater than or equal to ABC");
	''' }</pre>
	''' </blockquote>
	''' 
	''' <p>
	''' You can set a <code>Collator</code>'s <em>strength</em> property
	''' to determine the level of difference considered significant in
	''' comparisons. Four strengths are provided: <code>PRIMARY</code>,
	''' <code>SECONDARY</code>, <code>TERTIARY</code>, and <code>IDENTICAL</code>.
	''' The exact assignment of strengths to language features is
	''' locale dependant.  For example, in Czech, "e" and "f" are considered
	''' primary differences, while "e" and "&#283;" are secondary differences,
	''' "e" and "E" are tertiary differences and "e" and "e" are identical.
	''' The following shows how both case and accents could be ignored for
	''' US English.
	''' <blockquote>
	''' <pre>
	''' //Get the Collator for US English and set its strength to PRIMARY
	''' Collator usCollator = Collator.getInstance(Locale.US);
	''' usCollator.setStrength(Collator.PRIMARY);
	''' if( usCollator.compare("abc", "ABC") == 0 ) {
	'''     System.out.println("Strings are equivalent");
	''' }
	''' </pre>
	''' </blockquote>
	''' <p>
	''' For comparing <code>String</code>s exactly once, the <code>compare</code>
	''' method provides the best performance. When sorting a list of
	''' <code>String</code>s however, it is generally necessary to compare each
	''' <code>String</code> multiple times. In this case, <code>CollationKey</code>s
	''' provide better performance. The <code>CollationKey</code> class converts
	''' a <code>String</code> to a series of bits that can be compared bitwise
	''' against other <code>CollationKey</code>s. A <code>CollationKey</code> is
	''' created by a <code>Collator</code> object for a given <code>String</code>.
	''' <br>
	''' <strong>Note:</strong> <code>CollationKey</code>s from different
	''' <code>Collator</code>s can not be compared. See the class description
	''' for <seealso cref="CollationKey"/>
	''' for an example using <code>CollationKey</code>s.
