Namespace java.awt

	''' <summary>
	''' Defines an interface for classes that know how to layout Containers
	''' based on a layout constraints object.
	''' 
	''' This interface extends the LayoutManager interface to deal with layouts
	''' explicitly in terms of constraint objects that specify how and where
	''' components should be added to the layout.
	''' <p>
	''' This minimal extension to LayoutManager is intended for tool
	''' providers who wish to the creation of constraint-based layouts.
	''' It does not yet provide full, general support for custom
	''' constraint-based layout managers.
