	''' <summary>
	''' The interface for objects expressing interest in image data through
	''' the ImageProducer interfaces.  When a consumer is added to an image
	''' producer, the producer delivers all of the data about the image
	''' using the method calls defined in this interface.

		''' Sets the ColorModel object used for the majority of
		''' the pixels reported using the setPixels method
		''' calls.  Note that each set of pixels delivered using setPixels
		''' contains its own ColorModel object, so no assumption should
		''' be made that this model will be the only one used in delivering
		''' pixel values.  A notable case where multiple ColorModel objects
		''' may be seen is a filtered image when for each set of pixels
		''' that it filters, the filter
		''' determines  whether the
		''' pixels can be sent on untouched, using the original ColorModel,
		''' or whether the pixels should be modified (filtered) and passed
		''' on using a ColorModel more convenient for the filtering process. </summary>

		''' Sets the hints that the ImageConsumer uses to process the

		''' The ImageProducer can deliver the pixels in any order, but
		''' the ImageConsumer may be able to scale or convert the pixels
		''' to the destination ColorModel more efficiently or with higher
		''' quality if it knows some information about how the pixels will
		''' be delivered up front.  The setHints method should be called
		''' before any calls to any of the setPixels methods with a bit mask
		''' of hints about the manner in which the pixels will be delivered.
		''' If the ImageProducer does not follow the guidelines for the
		''' indicated hint, the results are undefined. </summary>

		''' The pixels will be delivered in a random order.  This tells the
		''' ImageConsumer not to use any optimizations that depend on the
