	''' <summary>
	''' This class performs an arbitrary linear combination of the bands
	''' in a <CODE>Raster</CODE>, using a specified matrix.
	''' <p>
	''' The width of the matrix must be equal to the number of bands in the
	''' source <CODE>Raster</CODE>, optionally plus one.  If there is one more
	''' column in the matrix than the number of bands, there is an implied 1 at the
	''' end of the vector of band samples representing a pixel.  The height
	''' of the matrix must be equal to the number of bands in the destination.
	''' <p>
	''' For example, a 3-banded <CODE>Raster</CODE> might have the following
	''' transformation applied to each pixel in order to invert the second band of
	''' the <CODE>Raster</CODE>.
