	''' <summary>
	''' An ImageFilter class for scaling images using a simple area averaging
	''' algorithm that produces smoother results than the nearest neighbor
	''' algorithm.
	''' <p>This class extends the basic ImageFilter Class to scale an existing
	''' image and provide a source for a new image containing the resampled
	''' image.  The pixels in the source image are blended to produce pixels
	''' for an image of the specified size.  The blending process is analogous
	''' to scaling up the source image to a multiple of the destination size
	''' using pixel replication and then scaling it back down to the destination
	''' size by simply averaging all the pixels in the supersized image that
	''' fall within a given pixel of the destination image.  If the data from
	''' the source is not delivered in TopDownLeftRight order then the filter
	''' will back off to a simple pixel replication behavior and utilize the
	''' requestTopDownLeftRightResend() method to refilter the pixels in a
	''' better way at the end.
	''' <p>It is meant to be used in conjunction with a FilteredImageSource
	''' object to produce scaled versions of existing images.  Due to
	''' implementation dependencies, there may be differences in pixel values
	''' of an image filtered on different platforms.
