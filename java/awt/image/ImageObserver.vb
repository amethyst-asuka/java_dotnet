	''' <summary>
	''' An asynchronous update interface for receiving notifications about
	''' Image information as the Image is constructed.
	''' 
	''' @author      Jim Graham
	''' </summary>
	Public Interface ImageObserver
		''' <summary>
		''' This method is called when information about an image which was
		''' previously requested using an asynchronous interface becomes
		''' available.  Asynchronous interfaces are method calls such as
		''' getWidth(ImageObserver) and drawImage(img, x, y, ImageObserver)
		''' which take an ImageObserver object as an argument.  Those methods
		''' register the caller as interested either in information about
		''' the overall image itself (in the case of getWidth(ImageObserver))
		''' or about an output version of an image (in the case of the
		''' drawImage(img, x, y, [w, h,] ImageObserver) call).
		''' 
		''' <p>This method
		''' should return true if further updates are needed or false if the
		''' required information has been acquired.  The image which was being
		''' tracked is passed in using the img argument.  Various constants
		''' are combined to form the infoflags argument which indicates what
		''' information about the image is now available.  The interpretation
		''' of the x, y, width, and height arguments depends on the contents
		''' of the infoflags argument.
		''' <p>
		''' The <code>infoflags</code> argument should be the bitwise inclusive
		''' <b>OR</b> of the following flags: <code>WIDTH</code>,
		''' <code>HEIGHT</code>, <code>PROPERTIES</code>, <code>SOMEBITS</code>,
		''' <code>FRAMEBITS</code>, <code>ALLBITS</code>, <code>ERROR</code>,
		''' <code>ABORT</code>.
		''' </summary>

		'''               <code>PROPERTIES</code>, <code>SOMEBITS</code>,
		'''               <code>FRAMEBITS</code>, <code>ALLBITS</code>,
