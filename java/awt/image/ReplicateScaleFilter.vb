	''' <summary>
	''' An ImageFilter class for scaling images using the simplest algorithm.
	''' This class extends the basic ImageFilter Class to scale an existing
	''' image and provide a source for a new image containing the resampled
	''' image.  The pixels in the source image are sampled to produce pixels
	''' for an image of the specified size by replicating rows and columns of
	''' pixels to scale up or omitting rows and columns of pixels to scale
	''' down.
	''' <p>It is meant to be used in conjunction with a FilteredImageSource
	''' object to produce scaled versions of existing images.  Due to
	''' implementation dependencies, there may be differences in pixel values
	''' of an image filtered on different platforms.
