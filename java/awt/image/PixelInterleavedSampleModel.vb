	''' <summary>
	'''  This class represents image data which is stored in a pixel interleaved
	'''  fashion and for
	'''  which each sample of a pixel occupies one data element of the DataBuffer.
	'''  It subclasses ComponentSampleModel but provides a more efficient
	'''  implementation for accessing pixel interleaved image data than is provided
	'''  by ComponentSampleModel.  This class
	'''  stores sample data for all bands in a single bank of the
	'''  DataBuffer. Accessor methods are provided so that image data can be
	'''  manipulated directly. Pixel stride is the number of
	'''  data array elements between two samples for the same band on the same
	'''  scanline. Scanline stride is the number of data array elements between
	'''  a given sample and the corresponding sample in the same column of the next
	'''  scanline.  Band offsets denote the number
	'''  of data array elements from the first data array element of the bank
	'''  of the DataBuffer holding each band to the first sample of the band.
	'''  The bands are numbered from 0 to N-1.
	'''  Bank indices denote the correspondence between a bank of the data buffer
	'''  and a band of image data.
	'''  This class supports
	'''  <seealso cref="DataBuffer#TYPE_BYTE TYPE_BYTE"/>,
	'''  <seealso cref="DataBuffer#TYPE_USHORT TYPE_USHORT"/>,
	'''  <seealso cref="DataBuffer#TYPE_SHORT TYPE_SHORT"/>,
	'''  <seealso cref="DataBuffer#TYPE_INT TYPE_INT"/>,
	'''  <seealso cref="DataBuffer#TYPE_FLOAT TYPE_FLOAT"/> and
	'''  <seealso cref="DataBuffer#TYPE_DOUBLE TYPE_DOUBLE"/> datatypes.
