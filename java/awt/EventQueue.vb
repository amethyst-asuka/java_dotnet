	''' <summary>
	''' <code>EventQueue</code> is a platform-independent class
	''' that queues events, both from the underlying peer classes
	''' and from trusted application classes.
	''' <p>
	''' It encapsulates asynchronous event dispatch machinery which
	''' extracts events from the queue and dispatches them by calling
	''' <seealso cref="#dispatchEvent(AWTEvent) dispatchEvent(AWTEvent)"/> method
	''' on this <code>EventQueue</code> with the event to be dispatched
	''' as an argument.  The particular behavior of this machinery is
	''' implementation-dependent.  The only requirements are that events
	''' which were actually enqueued to this queue (note that events
	''' being posted to the <code>EventQueue</code> can be coalesced)
	''' are dispatched:
	''' <dl>
	'''   <dt> Sequentially.
	'''   <dd> That is, it is not permitted that several events from
	'''        this queue are dispatched simultaneously.
	'''   <dt> In the same order as they are enqueued.
	'''   <dd> That is, if <code>AWTEvent</code>&nbsp;A is enqueued
	'''        to the <code>EventQueue</code> before
	'''        <code>AWTEvent</code>&nbsp;B then event B will not be
	'''        dispatched before event A.
	''' </dl>
	''' <p>
	''' Some browsers partition applets in different code bases into
	''' separate contexts, and establish walls between these contexts.
	''' In such a scenario, there will be one <code>EventQueue</code>
	''' per context. Other browsers place all applets into the same
	''' context, implying that there will be only a single, global
	''' <code>EventQueue</code> for all applets. This behavior is
	''' implementation-dependent.  Consult your browser's documentation
	''' for more information.
	''' <p>
	''' For information on the threading issues of the event dispatch
	''' machinery, see <a href="doc-files/AWTThreadIssues.html#Autoshutdown"
