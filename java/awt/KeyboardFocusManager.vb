	''' <summary>
	''' The KeyboardFocusManager is responsible for managing the active and focused
	''' Windows, and the current focus owner. The focus owner is defined as the
	''' Component in an application that will typically receive all KeyEvents
	''' generated by the user. The focused Window is the Window that is, or
	''' contains, the focus owner. Only a Frame or a Dialog can be the active
	''' Window. The native windowing system may denote the active Window or its
	''' children with special decorations, such as a highlighted title bar. The
	''' active Window is always either the focused Window, or the first Frame or
	''' Dialog that is an owner of the focused Window.
	''' <p>
	''' The KeyboardFocusManager is both a centralized location for client code to
	''' query for the focus owner and initiate focus changes, and an event
	''' dispatcher for all FocusEvents, WindowEvents related to focus, and
	''' KeyEvents.
	''' <p>
	''' Some browsers partition applets in different code bases into separate
	''' contexts, and establish walls between these contexts. In such a scenario,
	''' there will be one KeyboardFocusManager per context. Other browsers place all
	''' applets into the same context, implying that there will be only a single,
	''' global KeyboardFocusManager for all applets. This behavior is
	''' implementation-dependent. Consult your browser's documentation for more
	''' information. No matter how many contexts there may be, however, there can
	''' never be more than one focus owner, focused Window, or active Window, per
	''' ClassLoader.
	''' <p>
	''' Please see
	''' <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/focus.html">
	''' How to Use the Focus Subsystem</a>,
	''' a section in <em>The Java Tutorial</em>, and the
	''' <a href="../../java/awt/doc-files/FocusSpec.html">Focus Specification</a>

		' "replaceKFM" permission when a client code is on the call stack beneath,
		' but still it should be able to execute the methods protected by this check
		' due to the system KFM is trusted (and so it does like "privileged").
		'
		' If this KFM instance is not the current KFM but the client code has all
		' permissions we can't throw SecurityException because it would contradict
		' the security concepts. In this case the trusted client code is responsible
		' for calling the secured methods from KFM instance which is not current.
