	''' <summary>
	''' EventDispatchThread is a package-private AWT class which takes
	''' events off the EventQueue and dispatches them to the appropriate
	''' AWT components.
	''' 
	''' The Thread starts a "permanent" event pump with a call to
	''' pumpEvents(Conditional) in its run() method. Event handlers can choose to
	''' block this event pump at any time, but should start a new pump (<b>not</b>
	''' a new EventDispatchThread) by again calling pumpEvents(Conditional). This
	''' secondary event pump will exit automatically as soon as the Condtional
	''' evaluate()s to false and an additional Event is pumped and dispatched.
