Namespace java.awt.event

	''' <summary>
	''' An abstract adapter class for receiving mouse events.
	''' The methods in this class are empty. This class exists as
	''' convenience for creating listener objects.
	''' <P>
	''' Mouse events let you track when a mouse is pressed, released, clicked,
	''' moved, dragged, when it enters a component, when it exits and
	''' when a mouse wheel is moved.
	''' <P>
	''' Extend this class to create a {@code MouseEvent}
	''' (including drag and motion events) or/and {@code MouseWheelEvent}
	''' listener and override the methods for the events of interest. (If you implement the
	''' {@code MouseListener},
	''' {@code MouseMotionListener}
	''' interface, you have to define all of
	''' the methods in it. This abstract class defines null methods for them
	''' all, so you can only have to define methods for events you care about.)
	''' <P>
	''' Create a listener object using the extended class and then register it with
	''' a component using the component's {@code addMouseListener}
	''' {@code addMouseMotionListener}, {@code addMouseWheelListener}
	''' methods.
	''' The relevant method in the listener object is invoked  and the {@code MouseEvent}
	''' or {@code MouseWheelEvent}  is passed to it in following cases:
	''' <ul>
	''' <li>when a mouse button is pressed, released, or clicked (pressed and  released)
	''' <li>when the mouse cursor enters or exits the component
	''' <li>when the mouse wheel rotated, or mouse moved or dragged
	''' </ul>
