Namespace java.awt.event


	''' <summary>
	''' A low-level event which indicates that a component moved, changed
	''' size, or changed visibility (also, the root class for the other
	''' component-level events).
	''' <P>
	''' Component events are provided for notification purposes ONLY;
	''' The AWT will automatically handle component moves and resizes
	''' internally so that GUI layout works properly regardless of
	''' whether a program is receiving these events or not.
	''' <P>
	''' In addition to serving as the base class for other component-related
	''' events (InputEvent, FocusEvent, WindowEvent, ContainerEvent),
	''' this class defines the events that indicate changes in
	''' a component's size, position, or visibility.
	''' <P>
	''' This low-level event is generated by a component object (such as a
	''' List) when the component is moved, resized, rendered invisible, or made
	''' visible again. The event is passed to every <code>ComponentListener</code>
	''' or <code>ComponentAdapter</code> object which registered to receive such
	''' events using the component's <code>addComponentListener</code> method.
	''' (<code>ComponentAdapter</code> objects implement the
	''' <code>ComponentListener</code> interface.) Each such listener object
	''' gets this <code>ComponentEvent</code> when the event occurs.
	''' <p>
	''' An unspecified behavior will be caused if the {@code id} parameter
	''' of any particular {@code ComponentEvent} instance is not
	''' in the range from {@code COMPONENT_FIRST} to {@code COMPONENT_LAST}.
