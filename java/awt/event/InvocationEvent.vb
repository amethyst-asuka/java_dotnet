	''' <summary>
	''' An event which executes the <code>run()</code> method on a <code>Runnable
	''' </code> when dispatched by the AWT event dispatcher thread. This class can
	''' be used as a reference implementation of <code>ActiveEvent</code> rather
	''' than declaring a new class and defining <code>dispatch()</code>.<p>
	''' 
	''' Instances of this class are placed on the <code>EventQueue</code> by calls
	''' to <code>invokeLater</code> and <code>invokeAndWait</code>. Client code
	''' can use this fact to write replacement functions for <code>invokeLater
	''' </code> and <code>invokeAndWait</code> without writing special-case code
	''' in any <code>AWTEventListener</code> objects.
	''' <p>
	''' An unspecified behavior will be caused if the {@code id} parameter
	''' of any particular {@code InvocationEvent} instance is not
	''' in the range from {@code INVOCATION_FIRST} to {@code INVOCATION_LAST}.
