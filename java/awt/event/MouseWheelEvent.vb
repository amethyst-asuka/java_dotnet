	''' <summary>
	''' An event which indicates that the mouse wheel was rotated in a component.
	''' <P>
	''' A wheel mouse is a mouse which has a wheel in place of the middle button.
	''' This wheel can be rotated towards or away from the user.  Mouse wheels are
	''' most often used for scrolling, though other uses are possible.
	''' <P>
	''' A MouseWheelEvent object is passed to every <code>MouseWheelListener</code>
	''' object which registered to receive the "interesting" mouse events using the
	''' component's <code>addMouseWheelListener</code> method.  Each such listener
	''' object gets a <code>MouseEvent</code> containing the mouse event.
	''' <P>
	''' Due to the mouse wheel's special relationship to scrolling Components,
	''' MouseWheelEvents are delivered somewhat differently than other MouseEvents.
	''' This is because while other MouseEvents usually affect a change on
	''' the Component directly under the mouse
	''' cursor (for instance, when clicking a button), MouseWheelEvents often have
	''' an effect away from the mouse cursor (moving the wheel while
	''' over a Component inside a ScrollPane should scroll one of the
	''' Scrollbars on the ScrollPane).
	''' <P>
	''' MouseWheelEvents start delivery from the Component underneath the
	''' mouse cursor.  If MouseWheelEvents are not enabled on the
	''' Component, the event is delivered to the first ancestor
	''' Container with MouseWheelEvents enabled.  This will usually be
	''' a ScrollPane with wheel scrolling enabled.  The source
	''' Component and x,y coordinates will be relative to the event's
	''' final destination (the ScrollPane).  This allows a complex
	''' GUI to be installed without modification into a ScrollPane, and
	''' for all MouseWheelEvents to be delivered to the ScrollPane for
	''' scrolling.
	''' <P>
	''' Some AWT Components are implemented using native widgets which
	''' display their own scrollbars and handle their own scrolling.
	''' The particular Components for which this is true will vary from
	''' platform to platform.  When the mouse wheel is
	''' moved over one of these Components, the event is delivered straight to
	''' the native widget, and not propagated to ancestors.
	''' <P>
	''' Platforms offer customization of the amount of scrolling that
	''' should take place when the mouse wheel is moved.  The two most
	''' common settings are to scroll a certain number of "units"
	''' (commonly lines of text in a text-based component) or an entire "block"
	''' (similar to page-up/page-down).  The MouseWheelEvent offers
	''' methods for conforming to the underlying platform settings.  These
	''' platform settings can be changed at any time by the user.  MouseWheelEvents
	''' reflect the most recent settings.
	''' <P>
	''' The <code>MouseWheelEvent</code> class includes methods for
	''' getting the number of "clicks" by which the mouse wheel is rotated.
	''' The <seealso cref="#getWheelRotation"/> method returns the integer number
	''' of "clicks" corresponding to the number of notches by which the wheel was
	''' rotated. In addition to this method, the <code>MouseWheelEvent</code>
	''' class provides the <seealso cref="#getPreciseWheelRotation"/> method which returns
	''' a double number of "clicks" in case a partial rotation occurred.
	''' The <seealso cref="#getPreciseWheelRotation"/> method is useful if a mouse supports
	''' a high-resolution wheel, such as a freely rotating wheel with no
	''' notches. Applications can benefit by using this method to process
	''' mouse wheel events more precisely, and thus, making visual perception
	''' smoother.
