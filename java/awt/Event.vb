	''' <b>NOTE:</b> The <code>Event</code> class is obsolete and is
	''' available only for backwards compatibility.  It has been replaced
	''' by the <code>AWTEvent</code> class and its subclasses.
	''' <p>
	''' <code>Event</code> is a platform-independent class that
	''' encapsulates events from the platform's Graphical User
	''' Interface in the Java&nbsp;1.0 event model. In Java&nbsp;1.1
	''' and later versions, the <code>Event</code> class is maintained
	''' only for backwards compatibility. The information in this
	''' class description is provided to assist programmers in
	''' converting Java&nbsp;1.0 programs to the new event model.
	''' <p>
	''' In the Java&nbsp;1.0 event model, an event contains an
	''' <seealso cref="Event#id"/> field
	''' that indicates what type of event it is and which other
	''' <code>Event</code> variables are relevant for the event.
	''' <p>
	''' For keyboard events, <seealso cref="Event#key"/>
	''' contains a value indicating which key was activated, and
	''' <seealso cref="Event#modifiers"/> contains the
	''' modifiers for that event.  For the KEY_PRESS and KEY_RELEASE
	''' event ids, the value of <code>key</code> is the unicode
	''' character code for the key. For KEY_ACTION and
	''' KEY_ACTION_RELEASE, the value of <code>key</code> is
	''' one of the defined action-key identifiers in the
	''' <code>Event</code> class (<code>PGUP</code>,
	''' <code>PGDN</code>, <code>F1</code>, <code>F2</code>, etc).
