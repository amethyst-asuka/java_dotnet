	''' <summary>
	''' A {@code Window} object is a top-level window with no borders and no
	''' menubar.
	''' The default layout for a window is {@code BorderLayout}.
	''' <p>
	''' A window must have either a frame, dialog, or another window defined as its
	''' owner when it's constructed.
	''' <p>
	''' In a multi-screen environment, you can create a {@code Window}
	''' on a different screen device by constructing the {@code Window}
	''' with <seealso cref="#Window(Window, GraphicsConfiguration)"/>.  The
	''' {@code GraphicsConfiguration} object is one of the
	''' {@code GraphicsConfiguration} objects of the target screen device.
	''' <p>
	''' In a virtual device multi-screen environment in which the desktop
	''' area could span multiple physical screen devices, the bounds of all
	''' configurations are relative to the virtual device coordinate system.
	''' The origin of the virtual-coordinate system is at the upper left-hand
	''' corner of the primary physical screen.  Depending on the location of
	''' the primary screen in the virtual device, negative coordinates are
	''' possible, as shown in the following figure.
	''' <p>
	''' <img src="doc-files/MultiScreen.gif"
	''' alt="Diagram shows virtual device containing 4 physical screens. Primary physical screen shows coords (0,0), other screen shows (-80,-100)."
	''' style="float:center; margin: 7px 10px;">
	''' <p>
	''' In such an environment, when calling {@code setLocation},
	''' you must pass a virtual coordinate to this method.  Similarly,
	''' calling {@code getLocationOnScreen} on a {@code Window} returns
	''' virtual device coordinates.  Call the {@code getBounds} method
	''' of a {@code GraphicsConfiguration} to find its origin in the virtual
	''' coordinate system.
	''' <p>
	''' The following code sets the location of a {@code Window}
	''' at (10, 10) relative to the origin of the physical screen
	''' of the corresponding {@code GraphicsConfiguration}.  If the
	''' bounds of the {@code GraphicsConfiguration} is not taken
	''' into account, the {@code Window} location would be set
	''' at (10, 10) relative to the virtual-coordinate system and would appear
	''' on the primary physical screen, which might be different from the
	''' physical screen of the specified {@code GraphicsConfiguration}.
	''' 
	''' <pre>
	'''      Window w = new Window(Window owner, GraphicsConfiguration gc);
	'''      Rectangle bounds = gc.getBounds();
	'''      w.setLocation(10 + bounds.x, 10 + bounds.y);
	''' </pre>
	''' 
	''' <p>
	''' Note: the location and size of top-level windows (including
	''' {@code Window}s, {@code Frame}s, and {@code Dialog}s)
	''' are under the control of the desktop's window management system.
	''' Calls to {@code setLocation}, {@code setSize}, and
	''' {@code setBounds} are requests (not directives) which are
	''' forwarded to the window management system.  Every effort will be
	''' made to honor such requests.  However, in some cases the window
	''' management system may ignore such requests, or modify the requested
	''' geometry in order to place and size the {@code Window} in a way
	''' that more closely matches the desktop settings.
	''' <p>
	''' Due to the asynchronous nature of native event handling, the results
	''' returned by {@code getBounds}, {@code getLocation},
	''' {@code getLocationOnScreen}, and {@code getSize} might not
	''' reflect the actual geometry of the Window on screen until the last
	''' request has been processed.  During the processing of subsequent
	''' requests these values might change accordingly while the window
	''' management system fulfills the requests.
	''' <p>
	''' An application may set the size and location of an invisible
	''' {@code Window} arbitrarily, but the window management system may
	''' subsequently change its size and/or location when the
	''' {@code Window} is made visible. One or more {@code ComponentEvent}s
	''' will be generated to indicate the new geometry.
	''' <p>
	''' Windows are capable of generating the following WindowEvents:
	''' WindowOpened, WindowClosed, WindowGainedFocus, WindowLostFocus.
