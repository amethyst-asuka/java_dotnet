    '''
    ''' <summary>
    ''' <code>TextLayout</code> is an immutable graphical representation of styled
    ''' character data.
    ''' <p>
    ''' It provides the following capabilities:
    ''' <ul>
    ''' <li>implicit bidirectional analysis and reordering,
    ''' <li>cursor positioning and movement, including split cursors for
    ''' mixed directional text,
    ''' <li>highlighting, including both logical and visual highlighting
    ''' for mixed directional text,
    ''' <li>multiple baselines (roman, hanging, and centered),
    ''' <li>hit testing,
    ''' <li>justification,
    ''' <li>default font substitution,
    ''' <li>metric information such as ascent, descent, and advance, and
    ''' <li>rendering
    ''' </ul>
    ''' <p>
    ''' A <code>TextLayout</code> object can be rendered using
    ''' its <code>draw</code> method.
    ''' <p>
    ''' <code>TextLayout</code> can be constructed either directly or through
    ''' the use of a <seealso cref="LineBreakMeasurer"/>.  When constructed directly, the
    ''' source text represents a single paragraph.  <code>LineBreakMeasurer</code>
    ''' allows styled text to be broken into lines that fit within a particular
    ''' width.  See the <code>LineBreakMeasurer</code> documentation for more
    ''' information.
    ''' <p>
    ''' <code>TextLayout</code> construction logically proceeds as follows:
    ''' <ul>
    ''' <li>paragraph attributes are extracted and examined,
    ''' <li>text is analyzed for bidirectional reordering, and reordering
    ''' information is computed if needed,
    ''' <li>text is segmented into style runs
    ''' <li>fonts are chosen for style runs, first by using a font if the
    ''' attribute <seealso cref="TextAttribute#FONT"/> is present, otherwise by computing
    ''' a default font using the attributes that have been defined
    ''' <li>if text is on multiple baselines, the runs or subruns are further
    ''' broken into subruns sharing a common baseline,
    ''' <li>glyphvectors are generated for each run using the chosen font,
    ''' <li>final bidirectional reordering is performed on the glyphvectors
    ''' </ul>
    ''' <p>
    ''' All graphical information returned from a <code>TextLayout</code>
    ''' object's methods is relative to the origin of the
    ''' <code>TextLayout</code>, which is the intersection of the
    ''' <code>TextLayout</code> object's baseline with its left edge.  Also,
    ''' coordinates passed into a <code>TextLayout</code> object's methods
    ''' are assumed to be relative to the <code>TextLayout</code> object's
    ''' origin.  Clients usually need to translate between a
    ''' <code>TextLayout</code> object's coordinate system and the coordinate
    ''' system in another object (such as a
    ''' <seealso cref="java.awt.Graphics Graphics"/> object).
    ''' <p>
    ''' <code>TextLayout</code> objects are constructed from styled text,
    ''' but they do not retain a reference to their source text.  Thus,
    ''' changes in the text previously used to generate a <code>TextLayout</code>
    ''' do not affect the <code>TextLayout</code>.
    ''' <p>
    ''' Three methods on a <code>TextLayout</code> object
    ''' (<code>getNextRightHit</code>, <code>getNextLeftHit</code>, and
    ''' <code>hitTestChar</code>) return instances of <seealso cref="TextHitInfo"/>.
    ''' The offsets contained in these <code>TextHitInfo</code> objects
    ''' are relative to the start of the <code>TextLayout</code>, <b>not</b>
    ''' to the text used to create the <code>TextLayout</code>.  Similarly,
    ''' <code>TextLayout</code> methods that accept <code>TextHitInfo</code>
    ''' instances as parameters expect the <code>TextHitInfo</code> object's
    ''' offsets to be relative to the <code>TextLayout</code>, not to any
    ''' underlying text storage model.
    ''' <p>
    ''' <strong>Examples</strong>:<p>
    ''' Constructing and drawing a <code>TextLayout</code> and its bounding
    ''' rectangle:
    ''' <blockquote><pre>
    '''   Graphics2D g = ...;
    '''   Point2D loc = ...;
    '''   Font font = Font.getFont("Helvetica-bold-italic");
    '''   FontRenderContext frc = g.getFontRenderContext();
    '''   TextLayout layout = new TextLayout("This is a string", font, frc);
    '''   layout.draw(g, (float)loc.getX(), (float)loc.getY());
    '''
    '''   Rectangle2D bounds = layout.getBounds();
    '''   bounds.setRect(bounds.getX()+loc.getX(),
    '''                  bounds.getY()+loc.getY(),
    '''                  bounds.getWidth(),
    '''                  bounds.getHeight());
    '''   g.draw(bounds);
    ''' </pre>
    ''' </blockquote>
    ''' <p>
    ''' Hit-testing a <code>TextLayout</code> (determining which character is at
    ''' a particular graphical location):
    ''' <blockquote><pre>
    '''   Point2D click = ...;
    '''   TextHitInfo hit = layout.hitTestChar(
    '''                         (float) (click.getX() - loc.getX()),
    '''                         (float) (click.getY() - loc.getY()));
    ''' </pre>
    ''' </blockquote>
    ''' <p>
    ''' Responding to a right-arrow key press:
    ''' <blockquote><pre>
    '''   int insertionIndex = ...;
    '''   TextHitInfo next = layout.getNextRightHit(insertionIndex);
    '''   if (next != null) {
    '''       // translate graphics to origin of layout on screen
    '''       g.translate(loc.getX(), loc.getY());
    '''       Shape[] carets = layout.getCaretShapes(next.getInsertionIndex());
    '''       g.draw(carets[0]);
    '''       if (carets[1] != null) {
    '''           g.draw(carets[1]);
    '''       }
    '''   }
    ''' </pre></blockquote>
    ''' <p>
    ''' Drawing a selection range corresponding to a substring in the source text.
    ''' The selected area may not be visually contiguous:
    ''' <blockquote><pre>
    '''   // selStart, selLimit should be relative to the layout,
    '''   // not to the source text
    '''
    '''   int selStart = ..., selLimit = ...;
    '''   Color selectionColor = ...;
    '''   Shape selection = layout.getLogicalHighlightShape(selStart, selLimit);
    '''   // selection may consist of disjoint areas
    '''   // graphics is assumed to be tranlated to origin of layout
    '''   g.setColor(selectionColor);
    '''   g.fill(selection);
    ''' </pre></blockquote>
    ''' <p>
    ''' Drawing a visually contiguous selection range.  The selection range may
    ''' correspond to more than one substring in the source text.  The ranges of
    ''' the corresponding source text substrings can be obtained with
    ''' <code>getLogicalRangesForVisualSelection()</code>:
    ''' <blockquote><pre>
    '''   TextHitInfo selStart = ..., selLimit = ...;
    '''   Shape selection = layout.getVisualHighlightShape(selStart, selLimit);
    '''   g.setColor(selectionColor);
    '''   g.fill(selection);
    '''   int[] ranges = getLogicalRangesForVisualSelection(selStart, selLimit);
    '''   // ranges[0], ranges[1] is the first selection range,
    '''   // ranges[2], ranges[3] is the second selection range, etc.
    ''' </pre></blockquote>
    ''' <p>
    ''' Note: Font rotations can cause text baselines to be rotated, and
    ''' multiple runs with different rotations can cause the baseline to
    ''' bend or zig-zag.  In order to account for this (rare) possibility,
    ''' some APIs are specified to return metrics and take parameters 'in
    ''' baseline-relative coordinates' (e.g. ascent, advance), and others
    ''' are in 'in standard coordinates' (e.g. getBounds).  Values in
    ''' baseline-relative coordinates map the 'x' coordinate to the
    ''' distance along the baseline, (positive x is forward along the
    ''' baseline), and the 'y' coordinate to a distance along the
    ''' perpendicular to the baseline at 'x' (positive y is 90 degrees
    ''' clockwise from the baseline vector).  Values in standard
    ''' coordinates are measured along the x and y axes, with 0,0 at the
    ''' origin of the TextLayout.  Documentation for each relevant API
    ''' indicates what values are in what coordinate system.  In general,
    ''' measurement-related APIs are in baseline-relative coordinates,
    ''' while display-related APIs are in standard coordinates.

        '     * Any TextHitInfo with characterOffset between 0 and characterCount-1,
        '     * inclusive, represents a valid position on the line.  Additionally,
        '     * [-1, trailing] and [characterCount, leading] are valid positions, and
        '     * represent positions at the logical start and end of the line,
        '     * respectively.
        '     *
        '     * The characterOffsets in TextHitInfo's used and returned by TextLayout
        '     * are relative to the beginning of the text layout, not necessarily to
        '     * the beginning of the text storage the client is using.
        '     *
        '     *
        '     * Every valid TextHitInfo has either one or two carets associated with it.
        '     * A caret is a visual location in the TextLayout indicating where text at
        '     * the TextHitInfo will be displayed on screen.  If a TextHitInfo
        '     * represents a location on a directional boundary, then there are two
        '     * possible visible positions for newly inserted text.  Consider the
        '     * following example, in which capital letters indicate right-to-left text,
        '     * and the overall line direction is left-to-right:
        '     *
        '     * Text Storage: [ a, b, C, D, E, f ]
        '     * Display:        a b E D C f
        '     *
        '     * The text hit info (1, t) represents the trailing side of 'b'.  If 'q',
        '     * a left-to-right character is inserted into the text storage at this
        '     * location, it will be displayed between the 'b' and the 'E':
        '     *
        '     * Text Storage: [ a, b, q, C, D, E, f ]
        '     * Display:        a b q E D C f
        '     *
        '     * However, if a 'W', which is right-to-left, is inserted into the storage
        '     * after 'b', the storage and display will be:
        '     *
        '     * Text Storage: [ a, b, W, C, D, E, f ]
        '     * Display:        a b E D C W f
        '     *
        '     * So, for the original text storage, two carets should be displayed for
        '     * location (1, t): one visually between 'b' and 'E' and one visually
        '     * between 'C' and 'f'.
        '     *
        '     *
        '     * When two carets are displayed for a TextHitInfo, one caret is the
        '     * 'strong' caret and the other is the 'weak' caret.  The strong caret
        '     * indicates where an inserted character will be displayed when that
        '     * character's direction is the same as the direction of the TextLayout.
        '     * The weak caret shows where an character inserted character will be
        '     * displayed when the character's direction is opposite that of the
        '     * TextLayout.
        '     *
        '     *
        '     * Clients should not be overly concerned with the details of correct
        '     * caret display. TextLayout.getCaretShapes(TextHitInfo) will return an
        '     * array of two paths representing where carets should be displayed.
        '     * The first path in the array is the strong caret; the second element,
        '     * if non-null, is the weak caret.  If the second element is null,
        '     * then there is no weak caret for the given TextHitInfo.
        '     *
        '     *
        '     * Since text can be visually reordered, logically consecutive
        '     * TextHitInfo's may not be visually consecutive.  One implication of this
        '     * is that a client cannot tell from inspecting a TextHitInfo whether the
        '     * hit represents the first (or last) caret in the layout.  Clients
        '     * can call getVisualOtherHit();  if the visual companion is
        '     * (-1, TRAILING) or (characterCount, LEADING), then the hit is at the
        '     * first (last) caret position in the layout.
