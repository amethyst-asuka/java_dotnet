	''' <summary>
	''' This class is used with the CHAR_REPLACEMENT attribute.
	''' <p>
	''' The <code>GraphicAttribute</code> class represents a graphic embedded
	''' in text. Clients subclass this class to implement their own char
	''' replacement graphics.  Clients wishing to embed shapes and images in
	''' text need not subclass this class.  Instead, clients can use the
	''' <seealso cref="ShapeGraphicAttribute"/> and <seealso cref="ImageGraphicAttribute"/>
	''' classes.
	''' <p>
	''' Subclasses must ensure that their objects are immutable once they
	''' are constructed.  Mutating a <code>GraphicAttribute</code> that
	''' is used in a <seealso cref="TextLayout"/> results in undefined behavior from the
	''' <code>TextLayout</code>.
