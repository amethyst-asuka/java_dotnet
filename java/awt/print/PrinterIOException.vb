	''' <summary>
	''' The <code>PrinterIOException</code> class is a subclass of
	''' <seealso cref="PrinterException"/> and is used to indicate that an IO error
	''' of some sort has occurred while printing.
	''' 
	''' <p>As of release 1.4, this exception has been retrofitted to conform to
	''' the general purpose exception-chaining mechanism.  The
	''' "<code>IOException</code> that terminated the print job"
	''' that is provided at construction time and accessed via the
	''' <seealso cref="#getIOException()"/> method is now known as the <i>cause</i>,
	''' and may be accessed via the <seealso cref="Throwable#getCause()"/> method,
	''' as well as the aforementioned "legacy method."
