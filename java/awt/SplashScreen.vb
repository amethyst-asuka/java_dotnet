	''' <summary>
	''' The splash screen can be displayed at application startup, before the
	''' Java Virtual Machine (JVM) starts. The splash screen is displayed as an
	''' undecorated window containing an image. You can use GIF, JPEG, or PNG files
	''' for the image. Animation is supported for the GIF format, while transparency
	''' is supported both for GIF and PNG.  The window is positioned at the center
	''' of the screen. The position on multi-monitor systems is not specified. It is
	''' platform and implementation dependent.  The splash screen window is closed
	''' automatically as soon as the first window is displayed by Swing/AWT (may be
	''' also closed manually using the Java API, see below).
	''' <P>
	''' If your application is packaged in a jar file, you can use the
	''' "SplashScreen-Image" option in a manifest file to show a splash screen.
	''' Place the image in the jar archive and specify the path in the option.
	''' The path should not have a leading slash.
	''' <BR>
	''' For example, in the <code>manifest.mf</code> file:
	''' <PRE>
	''' Manifest-Version: 1.0
	''' Main-Class: Test
	''' SplashScreen-Image: filename.gif
	''' </PRE>
	''' <P>
	''' If the Java implementation provides the command-line interface and you run
	''' your application by using the command line or a shortcut, use the Java
	''' application launcher option to show a splash screen. The Oracle reference
	''' implementation allows you to specify the splash screen image location with
	''' the {@code -splash:} option.
	''' <BR>
	''' For example:
	''' <PRE>
	''' java -splash:filename.gif Test
	''' </PRE>
	''' The command line interface has higher precedence over the manifest
	''' setting.
	''' <p>
	''' The splash screen will be displayed as faithfully as possible to present the
	''' whole splash screen image given the limitations of the target platform and
	''' display.
	''' <p>
	''' It is implied that the specified image is presented on the screen "as is",
	''' i.e. preserving the exact color values as specified in the image file. Under
	''' certain circumstances, though, the presented image may differ, e.g. when
	''' applying color dithering to present a 32 bits per pixel (bpp) image on a 16
	''' or 8 bpp screen. The native platform display configuration may also affect
	''' the colors of the displayed image (e.g.  color profiles, etc.)
	''' <p>
	''' The {@code SplashScreen} class provides the API for controlling the splash
	''' screen. This class may be used to close the splash screen, change the splash
	''' screen image, get the splash screen native window position/size, and paint
	''' in the splash screen. It cannot be used to create the splash screen. You
	''' should use the options provided by the Java implementation for that.
	''' <p>
	''' This class cannot be instantiated. Only a single instance of this class
	''' can exist, and it may be obtained by using the <seealso cref="#getSplashScreen()"/>
	''' static method. In case the splash screen has not been created at
	''' application startup via the command line or manifest file option,
	''' the <code>getSplashScreen</code> method returns <code>null</code>.
