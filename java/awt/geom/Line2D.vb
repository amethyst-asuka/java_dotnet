	''' <summary>
	''' This <code>Line2D</code> represents a line segment in {@code (x,y)}
	''' coordinate space.  This [Class], like all of the Java 2D API, uses a
	''' default coordinate system called <i>user space</i> in which the y-axis
	''' values increase downward and x-axis values increase to the right.  For
	''' more information on the user space coordinate system, see the
	''' <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/guide/2d/spec/j2d-intro.fm2.html#61857">
	''' Coordinate Systems</a> section of the Java 2D Programmer's Guide.
	''' <p>
	''' This class is only the abstract superclass for all objects that
	''' store a 2D line segment.
	''' The actual storage representation of the coordinates is left to
	''' the subclass.
