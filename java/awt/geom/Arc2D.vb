	''' <summary>
	''' <CODE>Arc2D</CODE> is the abstract superclass for all objects that
	''' store a 2D arc defined by a framing rectangle,
	''' start angle, angular extent (length of the arc), and a closure type
	''' (<CODE>OPEN</CODE>, <CODE>CHORD</CODE>, or <CODE>PIE</CODE>).
	''' <p>
	''' <a name="inscribes">
	''' The arc is a partial section of a full ellipse which
	''' inscribes the framing rectangle of its parent <seealso cref="RectangularShape"/>.
	''' </a>
	''' <a name="angles">
	''' The angles are specified relative to the non-square
	''' framing rectangle such that 45 degrees always falls on the line from
	''' the center of the ellipse to the upper right corner of the framing
	''' rectangle.
	''' As a result, if the framing rectangle is noticeably longer along one
	''' axis than the other, the angles to the start and end of the arc segment
	''' will be skewed farther along the longer axis of the frame.
	''' </a>
	''' <p>
	''' The actual storage representation of the coordinates is left to
	''' the subclass.
