	''' <summary>
	''' Abstract class representing a collection of Permission objects.
	''' 
	''' <p>With a PermissionCollection, you can:
	''' <UL>
	''' <LI> add a permission to the collection using the {@code add} method.
	''' <LI> check to see if a particular permission is implied in the
	'''      collection, using the {@code implies} method.
	''' <LI> enumerate all the permissions, using the {@code elements} method.
	''' </UL>
	''' 
	''' <p>When it is desirable to group together a number of Permission objects
	''' of the same type, the {@code newPermissionCollection} method on that
	''' particular type of Permission object should first be called. The default
	''' behavior (from the Permission [Class]) is to simply return null.
	''' Subclasses of class Permission override the method if they need to store
	''' their permissions in a particular PermissionCollection object in order
	''' to provide the correct semantics when the
	''' {@code PermissionCollection.implies} method is called.
	''' If a non-null value is returned, that PermissionCollection must be used.
	''' If null is returned, then the caller of {@code newPermissionCollection}
	''' is free to store permissions of the
	''' given type in any PermissionCollection they choose
	''' (one that uses a Hashtable, one that uses a Vector, etc).
	''' 
	''' <p>The PermissionCollection returned by the
	''' {@code Permission.newPermissionCollection}
	''' method is a homogeneous collection, which stores only Permission objects
	''' for a given Permission type.  A PermissionCollection may also be
	''' heterogeneous.  For example, Permissions is a PermissionCollection
	''' subclass that represents a collection of PermissionCollections.
	''' That is, its members are each a homogeneous PermissionCollection.
	''' For example, a Permissions object might have a FilePermissionCollection
	''' for all the FilePermission objects, a SocketPermissionCollection for all the
	''' SocketPermission objects, and so on. Its {@code add} method adds a
	''' permission to the appropriate collection.
	''' 
	''' <p>Whenever a permission is added to a heterogeneous PermissionCollection
	''' such as Permissions, and the PermissionCollection doesn't yet contain a
	''' PermissionCollection of the specified permission's type, the
	''' PermissionCollection should call
	''' the {@code newPermissionCollection} method on the permission's class
	''' to see if it requires a special PermissionCollection. If
	''' {@code newPermissionCollection}
	''' returns null, the PermissionCollection
	''' is free to store the permission in any type of PermissionCollection it
	''' desires (one using a Hashtable, one using a Vector, etc.). For example,
	''' the Permissions object uses a default PermissionCollection implementation
	''' that stores the permission objects in a Hashtable.
	''' 
	''' <p> Subclass implementations of PermissionCollection should assume
	''' that they may be called simultaneously from multiple threads,
	''' and therefore should be synchronized properly.  Furthermore,
	''' Enumerations returned via the {@code elements} method are
	''' not <em>fail-fast</em>.  Modifications to a collection should not be
	''' performed while enumerating over that collection.
