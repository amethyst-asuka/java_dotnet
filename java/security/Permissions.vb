	''' <summary>
	''' This class represents a heterogeneous collection of Permissions. That is,
	''' it contains different types of Permission objects, organized into
	''' PermissionCollections. For example, if any
	''' {@code java.io.FilePermission} objects are added to an instance of
	''' this [Class], they are all stored in a single
	''' PermissionCollection. It is the PermissionCollection returned by a call to
	''' the {@code newPermissionCollection} method in the FilePermission class.
	''' Similarly, any {@code java.lang.RuntimePermission} objects are
	''' stored in the PermissionCollection returned by a call to the
	''' {@code newPermissionCollection} method in the
	''' RuntimePermission class. Thus, this class represents a collection of
	''' PermissionCollections.
	''' 
	''' <p>When the {@code add} method is called to add a Permission, the
	''' Permission is stored in the appropriate PermissionCollection. If no such
	''' collection exists yet, the Permission object's class is determined and the
	''' {@code newPermissionCollection} method is called on that class to create
	''' the PermissionCollection and add it to the Permissions object. If
	''' {@code newPermissionCollection} returns null, then a default
	''' PermissionCollection that uses a hashtable will be created and used. Each
	''' hashtable entry stores a Permission object as both the key and the value.
	''' 
	''' <p> Enumerations returned via the {@code elements} method are
	''' not <em>fail-fast</em>.  Modifications to a collection should not be
	''' performed while enumerating over that collection.
