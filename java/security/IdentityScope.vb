	''' <summary>
	''' <p>This class represents a scope for identities. It is an Identity
	''' itself, and therefore has a name and can have a scope. It can also
	''' optionally have a public key and associated certificates.
	''' 
	''' <p>An IdentityScope can contain Identity objects of all kinds, including
	''' Signers. All types of Identity objects can be retrieved, added, and
	''' removed using the same methods. Note that it is possible, and in fact
	''' expected, that different types of identity scopes will
	''' apply different policies for their various operations on the
	''' various types of Identities.
	''' 
	''' <p>There is a one-to-one mapping between keys and identities, and
	''' there can only be one copy of one key per scope. For example, suppose
	''' <b>Acme Software, Inc</b> is a software publisher known to a user.
	''' Suppose it is an Identity, that is, it has a public key, and a set of
	''' associated certificates. It is named in the scope using the name
	''' "Acme Software". No other named Identity in the scope has the same
	''' public  key. Of course, none has the same name as well.
