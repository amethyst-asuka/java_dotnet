	''' <summary>
	''' This exception is thrown by
	''' {@code doPrivileged(PrivilegedExceptionAction)} and
	''' {@code doPrivileged(PrivilegedExceptionAction,
	''' AccessControlContext context)} to indicate
	''' that the action being performed threw a checked exception.  The exception
	''' thrown by the action can be obtained by calling the
	''' {@code getException} method.  In effect, an
	''' {@code PrivilegedActionException} is a "wrapper"
	''' for an exception thrown by a privileged action.
	''' 
	''' <p>As of release 1.4, this exception has been retrofitted to conform to
	''' the general purpose exception-chaining mechanism.  The "exception thrown
	''' by the privileged computation" that is provided at construction time and
	''' accessed via the <seealso cref="#getException()"/> method is now known as the
	''' <i>cause</i>, and may be accessed via the <seealso cref="Throwable#getCause()"/>
	''' method, as well as the aforementioned "legacy method."
