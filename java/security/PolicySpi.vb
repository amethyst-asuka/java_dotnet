	''' <summary>
	''' This class defines the <i>Service Provider Interface</i> (<b>SPI</b>)
	''' for the {@code Policy} class.
	''' All the abstract methods in this class must be implemented by each
	''' service provider who wishes to supply a Policy implementation.
	''' 
	''' <p> Subclass implementations of this abstract class must provide
	''' a public constructor that takes a {@code Policy.Parameters}
	''' object as an input parameter.  This constructor also must throw
	''' an IllegalArgumentException if it does not understand the
	''' {@code Policy.Parameters} input.
	'''

	''' @since 1.6
