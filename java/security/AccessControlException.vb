	''' <summary>
	''' <p> This exception is thrown by the AccessController to indicate
	''' that a requested access (to a critical system resource such as the
	''' file system or the network) is denied.
	''' 
	''' <p> The reason to deny access can vary.  For example, the requested
	''' permission might be of an incorrect type,  contain an invalid
	''' value, or request access that is not allowed according to the
	''' security policy.  Such information should be given whenever
	''' possible at the time the exception is thrown.
