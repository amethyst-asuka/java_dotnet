	''' <summary>
	''' This class defines the <i>Service Provider Interface</i> (<b>SPI</b>)
	''' for the {@code CertificateFactory} class.
	''' All the abstract methods in this class must be implemented by each
	''' cryptographic service provider who wishes to supply the implementation
	''' of a certificate factory for a particular certificate type, e.g., X.509.
	''' 
	''' <p>Certificate factories are used to generate certificate, certification path
	''' ({@code CertPath}) and certificate revocation list (CRL) objects from
	''' their encodings.
	''' 
	''' <p>A certificate factory for X.509 must return certificates that are an
	''' instance of {@code java.security.cert.X509Certificate}, and CRLs
	''' that are an instance of {@code java.security.cert.X509CRL}.

		''' <summary>
		''' Generates a certificate object and initializes it with
		''' the data read from the input stream {@code inStream}.
		''' 
		''' <p>In order to take advantage of the specialized certificate format
		''' supported by this certificate factory,
		''' the returned certificate object can be typecast to the corresponding
		''' certificate class. For example, if this certificate
		''' factory implements X.509 certificates, the returned certificate object
		''' can be typecast to the {@code X509Certificate} class.
		''' 
		''' <p>In the case of a certificate factory for X.509 certificates, the
		''' certificate provided in {@code inStream} must be DER-encoded and
		''' may be supplied in binary or printable (Base64) encoding. If the
		''' certificate is provided in Base64 encoding, it must be bounded at

		''' <p>Note that if the given input stream does not support
		''' <seealso cref="java.io.InputStream#mark(int) mark"/> and
		''' <seealso cref="java.io.InputStream#reset() reset"/>, this method will

		''' is positioned to the next available byte after the inherent
