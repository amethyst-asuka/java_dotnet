	''' <summary>
	''' A trust anchor or most-trusted Certification Authority (CA).
	''' <p>
	''' This class represents a "most-trusted CA", which is used as a trust anchor
	''' for validating X.509 certification paths. A most-trusted CA includes the
	''' public key of the CA, the CA's name, and any constraints upon the set of
	''' paths which may be validated using this key. These parameters can be
	''' specified in the form of a trusted {@code X509Certificate} or as
	''' individual parameters.
	''' <p>
	''' <b>Concurrent Access</b>
	''' <p>All {@code TrustAnchor} objects must be immutable and
	''' thread-safe. That is, multiple threads may concurrently invoke the
	''' methods defined in this class on a single {@code TrustAnchor}
	''' object (or more than one) with no ill effects. Requiring
	''' {@code TrustAnchor} objects to be immutable and thread-safe
	''' allows them to be passed around to various pieces of code without
	''' worrying about coordinating access. This stipulation applies to all
	''' public fields and methods of this class and any added or overridden
	''' by subclasses.
