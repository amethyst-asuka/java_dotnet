	''' <summary>
	''' The <i>Service Provider Interface</i> (<b>SPI</b>)
	''' for the <seealso cref="CertStore CertStore"/> class. All {@code CertStore}
	''' implementations must include a class (the SPI [Class]) that extends
	''' this class ({@code CertStoreSpi}), provides a constructor with
	''' a single argument of type {@code CertStoreParameters}, and implements
	''' all of its methods. In general, instances of this class should only be
	''' accessed through the {@code CertStore} class.
	''' For details, see the Java Cryptography Architecture.
	''' <p>
	''' <b>Concurrent Access</b>
	''' <p>
	''' The public methods of all {@code CertStoreSpi} objects must be
	''' thread-safe. That is, multiple threads may concurrently invoke these
	''' methods on a single {@code CertStoreSpi} object (or more than one)
	''' with no ill effects. This allows a {@code CertPathBuilder} to search
	''' for a CRL while simultaneously searching for further certificates, for
	''' instance.
	''' <p>
	''' Simple {@code CertStoreSpi} implementations will probably ensure
	''' thread safety by adding a {@code synchronized} keyword to their
	''' {@code engineGetCertificates} and {@code engineGetCRLs} methods.
	''' More sophisticated ones may allow truly concurrent access.
