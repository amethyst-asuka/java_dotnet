	''' <summary>
	''' This interface represents an X.509 extension.
	''' 
	''' <p>
	''' Extensions provide a means of associating additional attributes with users
	''' or public keys and for managing a certification hierarchy.  The extension
	''' format also allows communities to define private extensions to carry
	''' information unique to those communities.
	''' 
	''' <p>
	''' Each extension contains an object identifier, a criticality setting
	''' indicating whether it is a critical or a non-critical extension, and
	''' and an ASN.1 DER-encoded value. Its ASN.1 definition is:
	''' 
	''' <pre>
	''' 
	'''     Extension ::= SEQUENCE {
	'''         extnId        OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
	'''         critical      BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
	'''         extnValue     OCTET STRING
	'''                 -- contains a DER encoding of a value
	'''                 -- of the type registered for use with
	'''                 -- the extnId object identifier value
	'''     }
	''' 
	''' </pre>
	''' 
	''' <p>
	''' This interface is designed to provide access to a single extension,
	''' unlike <seealso cref="java.security.cert.X509Extension"/> which is more suitable
	''' for accessing a set of extensions.
	''' 
	''' @since 1.7
