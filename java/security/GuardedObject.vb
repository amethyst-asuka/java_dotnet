	''' <summary>
	''' A GuardedObject is an object that is used to protect access to
	''' another object.
	''' 
	''' <p>A GuardedObject encapsulates a target object and a Guard object,
	''' such that access to the target object is possible
	''' only if the Guard object allows it.
	''' Once an object is encapsulated by a GuardedObject,
	''' access to that object is controlled by the {@code getObject}
	''' method, which invokes the
	''' {@code checkGuard} method on the Guard object that is
	''' guarding access. If access is not allowed,
	''' an exception is thrown.
