	''' <summary>
	''' This class provides a cryptographically strong random number
	''' generator (RNG).
	''' 
	''' <p>A cryptographically strong random number
	''' minimally complies with the statistical random number generator tests
	''' specified in <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval/140-2.htm">
	''' <i>FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules</i></a>,
	''' section 4.9.1.
	''' Additionally, SecureRandom must produce non-deterministic output.
	''' Therefore any seed material passed to a SecureRandom object must be
	''' unpredictable, and all SecureRandom output sequences must be
	''' cryptographically strong, as described in
	''' <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1750.txt">
	''' <i>RFC 1750: Randomness Recommendations for Security</i></a>.
	''' 
	''' <p>A caller obtains a SecureRandom instance via the
	''' no-argument constructor or one of the {@code getInstance} methods:
	''' 
	''' <pre>
	'''      SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
	''' </pre>
	''' 
	''' <p> Many SecureRandom implementations are in the form of a pseudo-random
	''' number generator (PRNG), which means they use a deterministic algorithm
	''' to produce a pseudo-random sequence from a true random seed.
	''' Other implementations may produce true random numbers,
	''' and yet others may use a combination of both techniques.
	''' 
	''' <p> Typical callers of SecureRandom invoke the following methods
	''' to retrieve random bytes:
	''' 
	''' <pre>
	'''      SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
	'''      byte bytes[] = new byte[20];
	'''      random.nextBytes(bytes);
	''' </pre>
	''' 
	''' <p> Callers may also invoke the {@code generateSeed} method
	''' to generate a given number of seed bytes (to seed other random number
	''' generators, for example):
	''' <pre>
	'''      byte seed[] = random.generateSeed(20);
	''' </pre>
	''' 
	''' Note: Depending on the implementation, the {@code generateSeed} and
	''' {@code nextBytes} methods may block as entropy is being gathered,
	''' for example, if they need to read from /dev/random on various Unix-like
	''' operating systems.
