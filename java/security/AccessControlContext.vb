	''' <summary>
	''' An AccessControlContext is used to make system resource access decisions
	''' based on the context it encapsulates.
	''' 
	''' <p>More specifically, it encapsulates a context and
	''' has a single method, {@code checkPermission},
	''' that is equivalent to the {@code checkPermission} method
	''' in the AccessController [Class], with one difference: The AccessControlContext
	''' {@code checkPermission} method makes access decisions based on the
	''' context it encapsulates,
	''' rather than that of the current execution thread.
	''' 
	''' <p>Thus, the purpose of AccessControlContext is for those situations where
	''' a security check that should be made within a given context
	''' actually needs to be done from within a
	''' <i>different</i> context (for example, from within a worker thread).
	''' 
	''' <p> An AccessControlContext is created by calling the
	''' {@code AccessController.getContext} method.
	''' The {@code getContext} method takes a "snapshot"
	''' of the current calling context, and places
	''' it in an AccessControlContext object, which it returns. A sample call is
	''' the following:
	''' 
	''' <pre>
	'''   AccessControlContext acc = AccessController.getContext()
	''' </pre>
	''' 
	''' <p>
	''' Code within a different context can subsequently call the
	''' {@code checkPermission} method on the
	''' previously-saved AccessControlContext object. A sample call is the
	''' following:
	''' 
	''' <pre>
	'''   acc.checkPermission(permission)
	''' </pre>
