	''' <summary>
	''' The UnresolvedPermission class is used to hold Permissions that
	''' were "unresolved" when the Policy was initialized.
	''' An unresolved permission is one whose actual Permission class
	''' does not yet exist at the time the Policy is initialized (see below).
	''' 
	''' <p>The policy for a Java runtime (specifying
	''' which permissions are available for code from various principals)
	''' is represented by a Policy object.
	''' Whenever a Policy is initialized or refreshed, Permission objects of
	''' appropriate classes are created for all permissions
	''' allowed by the Policy.
	''' 
	''' <p>Many permission class types
	''' referenced by the policy configuration are ones that exist
	''' locally (i.e., ones that can be found on CLASSPATH).
	''' Objects for such permissions can be instantiated during
	''' Policy initialization. For example, it is always possible
	''' to instantiate a java.io.FilePermission, since the
	''' FilePermission class is found on the CLASSPATH.
	''' 
	''' <p>Other permission classes may not yet exist during Policy
	''' initialization. For example, a referenced permission class may
	''' be in a JAR file that will later be loaded.
	''' For each such [Class], an UnresolvedPermission is instantiated.
	''' Thus, an UnresolvedPermission is essentially a "placeholder"
	''' containing information about the permission.
	''' 
	''' <p>Later, when code calls AccessController.checkPermission
	''' on a permission of a type that was previously unresolved,
	''' but whose class has since been loaded, previously-unresolved
	''' permissions of that type are "resolved". That is,
	''' for each such UnresolvedPermission, a new object of
	''' the appropriate class type is instantiated, based on the
	''' information in the UnresolvedPermission.
	''' 
	''' <p> To instantiate the new [Class], UnresolvedPermission assumes
	''' the class provides a zero, one, and/or two-argument constructor.
	''' The zero-argument constructor would be used to instantiate
	''' a permission without a name and without actions.
	''' A one-arg constructor is assumed to take a {@code String}
	''' name as input, and a two-arg constructor is assumed to take a
	''' {@code String} name and {@code String} actions
	''' as input.  UnresolvedPermission may invoke a
	''' constructor with a {@code null} name and/or actions.
	''' If an appropriate permission constructor is not available,
	''' the UnresolvedPermission is ignored and the relevant permission
	''' will not be granted to executing code.
	''' 
	''' <p> The newly created permission object replaces the
	''' UnresolvedPermission, which is removed.
	''' 
	''' <p> Note that the {@code getName} method for an
	''' {@code UnresolvedPermission} returns the
	''' {@code type} (class name) for the underlying permission
	''' that has not been resolved.
