	''' <summary>
	''' An <code>RMISocketFactory</code> instance is used by the RMI runtime
	''' in order to obtain client and server sockets for RMI calls.  An
	''' application may use the <code>setSocketFactory</code> method to
	''' request that the RMI runtime use its socket factory instance
	''' instead of the default implementation.
	''' 
	''' <p>The default socket factory implementation performs a
	''' three-tiered approach to creating client sockets. First, a direct
	''' socket connection to the remote VM is attempted.  If that fails
	''' (due to a firewall), the runtime uses HTTP with the explicit port
	''' number of the server.  If the firewall does not allow this type of
	''' communication, then HTTP to a cgi-bin script on the server is used
	''' to POST the RMI call. The HTTP tunneling mechanisms are disabled by
	''' default. This behavior is controlled by the {@code java.rmi.server.disableHttp}
	''' property, whose default value is {@code true}. Setting this property's
	''' value to {@code false} will enable the HTTP tunneling mechanisms.
	''' 
	''' <p><strong>Deprecated: HTTP Tunneling.</strong> <em>The HTTP tunneling mechanisms
	''' described above, specifically HTTP with an explicit port and HTTP to a
	''' cgi-bin script, are deprecated. These HTTP tunneling mechanisms are
	''' subject to removal in a future release of the platform.</em>
	''' 
	''' <p>The default socket factory implementation creates server sockets that
	''' are bound to the wildcard address, which accepts requests from all network
	''' interfaces.
	''' 
	''' @implNote
	''' <p>You can use the {@code RMISocketFactory} class to create a server socket that
	''' is bound to a specific address, restricting the origin of requests. For example,
	''' the following code implements a socket factory that binds server sockets to an IPv4
	''' loopback address. This restricts RMI to processing requests only from the local host.
	''' 
	''' <pre>{@code
	'''     class LoopbackSocketFactory extends RMISocketFactory {
	'''         public ServerSocket createServerSocket(int port) throws IOException {
	'''             return new ServerSocket(port, 5, InetAddress.getByName("127.0.0.1"));
	'''         }
	''' 
	'''         public Socket createSocket(String host, int port) throws IOException {
	'''             // just call the default client socket factory
	'''             return RMISocketFactory.getDefaultSocketFactory()
	'''                                    .createSocket(host, port);
	'''         }
	'''     }
	''' 
	'''     // ...
	''' 
	'''     RMISocketFactory.setSocketFactory(new LoopbackSocketFactory());
	''' }</pre>
	''' 
	''' Set the {@code java.rmi.server.hostname} system property
	''' to {@code 127.0.0.1} to ensure that the generated stubs connect to the right
	''' network interface.
