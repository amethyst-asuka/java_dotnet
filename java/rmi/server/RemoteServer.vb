	''' <summary>
	''' The <code>RemoteServer</code> class is the common superclass to server
	''' implementations and provides the framework to support a wide range
	''' of remote reference semantics.  Specifically, the functions needed
	''' to create and export remote objects (i.e. to make them remotely
	''' available) are provided abstractly by <code>RemoteServer</code> and
	''' concretely by its subclass(es).
