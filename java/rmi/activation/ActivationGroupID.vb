Namespace java.rmi.activation


	''' <summary>
	''' The identifier for a registered activation group serves several
	''' purposes: <ul>
	''' <li>identifies the group uniquely within the activation system, and
	''' <li>contains a reference to the group's activation system so that the
	''' group can contact its activation system when necessary.</ul><p>
	''' 
	''' The <code>ActivationGroupID</code> is returned from the call to
	''' <code>ActivationSystem.registerGroup</code> and is used to identify
	''' the group within the activation system. This group id is passed
	''' as one of the arguments to the activation group's special constructor
	''' when an activation group is created/recreated.
