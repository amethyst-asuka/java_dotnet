	''' <summary>
	''' An <code>ActivationGroup</code> is responsible for creating new
	''' instances of "activatable" objects in its group, informing its
	''' <code>ActivationMonitor</code> when either: its object's become
	''' active or inactive, or the group as a whole becomes inactive. <p>
	''' 
	''' An <code>ActivationGroup</code> is <i>initially</i> created in one
	''' of several ways: <ul>
	''' <li>as a side-effect of creating an <code>ActivationDesc</code>
	'''     without an explicit <code>ActivationGroupID</code> for the
	'''     first activatable object in the group, or
	''' <li>via the <code>ActivationGroup.createGroup</code> method
	''' <li>as a side-effect of activating the first object in a group
	'''     whose <code>ActivationGroupDesc</code> was only registered.</ul><p>
	''' 
	''' Only the activator can <i>recreate</i> an
	''' <code>ActivationGroup</code>.  The activator spawns, as needed, a
	''' separate VM (as a child process, for example) for each registered
	''' activation group and directs activation requests to the appropriate
	''' group. It is implementation specific how VMs are spawned. An
	''' activation group is created via the
	''' <code>ActivationGroup.createGroup</code> static method. The
	''' <code>createGroup</code> method has two requirements on the group
	''' to be created: 1) the group must be a concrete subclass of
	''' <code>ActivationGroup</code>, and 2) the group must have a
	''' constructor that takes two arguments:
	''' 
	''' <ul>
	''' <li> the group's <code>ActivationGroupID</code>, and
	''' <li> the group's initialization data (in a
	'''      <code>java.rmi.MarshalledObject</code>)</ul><p>
	''' 
	''' When created, the default implementation of
	''' <code>ActivationGroup</code> will override the system properties
	''' with the properties requested when its
	''' <code>ActivationGroupDesc</code> was created, and will set a
	''' <seealso cref="SecurityManager"/> as the default system
	''' security manager.  If your application requires specific properties
	''' to be set when objects are activated in the group, the application
	''' should create a special <code>Properties</code> object containing
	''' these properties, then create an <code>ActivationGroupDesc</code>
	''' with the <code>Properties</code> object, and use
	''' <code>ActivationGroup.createGroup</code> before creating any
	''' <code>ActivationDesc</code>s (before the default
	''' <code>ActivationGroupDesc</code> is created).  If your application
	''' requires the use of a security manager other than
	''' <seealso cref="SecurityManager"/>, in the
	''' ActivativationGroupDescriptor properties list you can set
	''' <code>java.security.manager</code> property to the name of the security
	''' manager you would like to install.
