	''' <summary>
	''' A time without a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
	''' such as {@code 10:15:30}.
	''' <p>
	''' {@code LocalTime} is an immutable date-time object that represents a time,
	''' often viewed as hour-minute-second.
	''' Time is represented to nanosecond precision.
	''' For example, the value "13:45.30.123456789" can be stored in a {@code LocalTime}.
	''' <p>
	''' This class does not store or represent a date or time-zone.
	''' Instead, it is a description of the local time as seen on a wall clock.
	''' It cannot represent an instant on the time-line without additional information
	''' such as an offset or time-zone.
	''' <p>
	''' The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
	''' in most of the world. This API assumes that all calendar systems use the same
	''' representation, this [Class], for time-of-day.
	''' 
	''' <p>
	''' This is a <a href="{@docRoot}/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>
	''' class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
	''' ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of
	''' {@code LocalTime} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
	''' The {@code equals} method should be used for comparisons.
	''' 
	''' @implSpec
	''' This class is immutable and thread-safe.
