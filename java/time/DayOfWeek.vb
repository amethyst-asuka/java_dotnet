	''' <summary>
	''' A day-of-week, such as 'Tuesday'.
	''' <p>
	''' {@code DayOfWeek} is an enum representing the 7 days of the week -
	''' Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
	''' <p>
	''' In addition to the textual enum name, each day-of-week has an {@code int} value.
	''' The {@code int} value follows the ISO-8601 standard, from 1 (Monday) to 7 (Sunday).
	''' It is recommended that applications use the enum rather than the {@code int} value
	''' to ensure code clarity.
	''' <p>
	''' This enum provides access to the localized textual form of the day-of-week.
	''' Some locales also assign different numeric values to the days, declaring
	''' Sunday to have the value 1, however this class provides no support for this.
	''' See <seealso cref="WeekFields"/> for localized week-numbering.
	''' <p>
	''' <b>Do not use {@code ordinal()} to obtain the numeric representation of {@code DayOfWeek}.
	''' Use {@code getValue()} instead.</b>
	''' <p>
	''' This enum represents a common concept that is found in many calendar systems.
	''' As such, this enum may be used by any calendar system that has the day-of-week
	''' concept defined exactly equivalent to the ISO calendar system.
	''' 
	''' @implSpec
	''' This is an immutable and thread-safe enum.
	''' 
	''' @since 1.8
