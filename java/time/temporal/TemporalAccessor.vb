Namespace java.time.temporal


	''' <summary>
	''' Framework-level interface defining read-only access to a temporal object,
	''' such as a date, time, offset or some combination of these.
	''' <p>
	''' This is the base interface type for date, time and offset objects.
	''' It is implemented by those classes that can provide information
	''' as <seealso cref="TemporalField fields"/> or <seealso cref="TemporalQuery queries"/>.
	''' <p>
	''' Most date and time information can be represented as a number.
	''' These are modeled using {@code TemporalField} with the number held using
	''' a {@code long} to handle large values. Year, month and day-of-month are
	''' simple examples of fields, but they also include instant and offsets.
	''' See <seealso cref="ChronoField"/> for the standard set of fields.
	''' <p>
	''' Two pieces of date/time information cannot be represented by numbers,
	''' the <seealso cref="java.time.chrono.Chronology chronology"/> and the
	''' <seealso cref="java.time.ZoneId time-zone"/>.
	''' These can be accessed via <seealso cref="#query(TemporalQuery) queries"/> using
	''' the static methods defined on <seealso cref="TemporalQuery"/>.
	''' <p>
	''' A sub-interface, <seealso cref="Temporal"/>, extends this definition to one that also
	''' supports adjustment and manipulation on more complete temporal objects.
	''' <p>
	''' This interface is a framework-level interface that should not be widely
	''' used in application code. Instead, applications should create and pass
	''' around instances of concrete types, such as {@code LocalDate}.
	''' There are many reasons for this, part of which is that implementations
	''' of this interface may be in calendar systems other than ISO.
	''' See <seealso cref="java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate"/> for a fuller discussion of the issues.
	''' 
	''' @implSpec
	''' This interface places no restrictions on the mutability of implementations,
	''' however immutability is strongly recommended.
	''' 
	''' @since 1.8
	''' </summary>
	Public Interface TemporalAccessor

		''' <summary>
		''' Checks if the specified field is supported.
		''' <p>
		''' This checks if the date-time can be queried for the specified field.
		''' If false, then calling the <seealso cref="#range(TemporalField) range"/> and <seealso cref="#get(TemporalField) get"/>
		''' methods will throw an exception.
		''' 
		''' @implSpec
		''' Implementations must check and handle all fields defined in <seealso cref="ChronoField"/>.
		''' If the field is supported, then true must be returned, otherwise false must be returned.
		''' <p>
		''' If the field is not a {@code ChronoField}, then the result of this method
		''' is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)}
		''' passing {@code this} as the argument.
		''' <p>
		''' Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
		''' read-only method is invoked.

		''' Gets the range of valid values for the specified field.

		''' All fields can be expressed as a {@code long}  java.lang.[Integer].
		''' This method returns an object that describes the valid range for that value.
		''' The value of this temporal object is used to enhance the accuracy of the returned range.
		''' If the date-time cannot return the range, because the field is unsupported or for
		''' some other reason, an exception will be thrown.
		''' <p>
		''' Note that the result only describes the minimum and maximum valid values
		''' and it is important not to read too much into them. For example, there
		''' could be values within the range that are invalid for the field.
		''' 
		''' @implSpec
		''' Implementations must check and handle all fields defined in <seealso cref="ChronoField"/>.
		''' If the field is supported, then the range of the field must be returned.
		''' If unsupported, then an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException} must be thrown.

		''' If the field is not a {@code ChronoField}, then the result of this method
		''' is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalField.rangeRefinedBy(TemporalAccessorl)}

		''' Examples might be a query that checks if the date is the day before February 29th
		''' in a leap year, or calculates the number of days to your next birthday.
		''' <p>
		''' The most common query implementations are method references, such as

		''' <p>
		''' If the implementation can supply a value for one of the queries listed in the
		''' if statement of the default implementation, then it must do so.
