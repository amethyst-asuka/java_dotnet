	''' <summary>
	''' A field of date-time, such as month-of-year or hour-of-minute.
	''' <p>
	''' Date and time is expressed using fields which partition the time-line into something
	''' meaningful for humans. Implementations of this interface represent those fields.
	''' <p>
	''' The most commonly used units are defined in <seealso cref="ChronoField"/>.
	''' Further fields are supplied in <seealso cref="IsoFields"/>, <seealso cref="WeekFields"/> and <seealso cref="JulianFields"/>.
	''' Fields can also be written by application code by implementing this interface.
	''' <p>
	''' The field works using double dispatch. Client code calls methods on a date-time like
	''' {@code LocalDateTime} which check if the field is a {@code ChronoField}.
	''' If it is, then the date-time must handle it.
	''' Otherwise, the method call is re-dispatched to the matching method in this interface.
	''' 
	''' @implSpec
	''' This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
	''' All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
	''' Implementations should be {@code Serializable} where possible.
	''' An enum is as effective implementation choice.
	''' 
	''' @since 1.8

		''' <summary>
		''' Resolves this field to provide a simpler alternative or a date.

		''' This method is invoked during the resolve phase of parsing.

		''' <p>
		''' Applications should not normally invoke this method directly.
		''' 
		''' @implSpec
		''' If an implementation represents a field that can be simplified, or
		''' combined with others, then this method must be implemented.
		''' <p>
		''' The specified map contains the current state of the parse.
		''' The map is mutable and must be mutated to resolve the field and
		''' any related fields. This method will only be invoked during parsing
		''' if the map contains this field, and implementations should therefore
		''' assume this field is present.
		''' <p>
		''' Resolving a field will consist of looking at the value of this field,
		''' and potentially other fields, and either updating the map with a
		''' simpler value, such as a {@code ChronoField}, or returning a
		''' complete {@code ChronoLocalDate}. If a resolve is successful,
		''' the code must remove all the fields that were resolved from the map,
		''' including this field.
		''' <p>
		''' For example, the {@code IsoFields} class contains the quarter-of-year
		''' and day-of-quarter fields. The implementation of this method in that class
		''' resolves the two fields plus the <seealso cref="ChronoField#YEAR YEAR"/> into a
		''' complete {@code LocalDate}. The resolve method will remove all three
		''' fields from the map before returning the {@code LocalDate}.
		''' <p>
		''' A partially complete temporal is used to allow the chronology and zone
		''' to be queried. In general, only the chronology will be needed.
		''' Querying items other than the zone or chronology is undefined and
		''' must not be relied on.
		''' The behavior of other methods such as {@code get}, {@code getLong},
		''' {@code range} and {@code isSupported} is unpredictable and the results undefined.
		''' <p>
		''' If resolution should be possible, but the data is invalid, the resolver
		''' style should be used to determine an appropriate level of leniency, which
		''' may require throwing a {@code DateTimeException} or {@code ArithmeticException}.
		''' If no resolution is possible, the resolve method must return null.
		''' <p>
		''' When resolving time fields, the map will be altered and null returned.
		''' When resolving date fields, the date is normally returned from the method,
		''' with the map altered to remove the resolved fields. However, it would also
		''' be acceptable for the date fields to be resolved into other {@code ChronoField}
		''' instances that can produce a date, such as {@code EPOCH_DAY}.
		''' <p>
		''' Not all {@code TemporalAccessor} implementations are accepted as return values.
		''' Implementations that call this method must accept {@code ChronoLocalDate},
		''' {@code ChronoLocalDateTime}, {@code ChronoZonedDateTime} and {@code LocalTime}.
