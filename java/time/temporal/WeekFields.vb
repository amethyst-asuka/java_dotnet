	''' Localized definitions of the day-of-week, week-of-month and week-of-year fields.
	''' <p>
	''' A standard week is seven days long, but cultures have different definitions for some
	''' other aspects of a week. This class represents the definition of the week, for the
	''' purpose of providing <seealso cref="TemporalField"/> instances.
	''' <p>
	''' WeekFields provides five fields,
	''' <seealso cref="#dayOfWeek()"/>, <seealso cref="#weekOfMonth()"/>, <seealso cref="#weekOfYear()"/>,
	''' <seealso cref="#weekOfWeekBasedYear()"/>, and <seealso cref="#weekBasedYear()"/>
	''' that provide access to the values from any <seealso cref="Temporal temporal object"/>.
	''' <p>
	''' The computations for day-of-week, week-of-month, and week-of-year are based
	''' on the  <seealso cref="ChronoField#YEAR proleptic-year"/>,
	''' <seealso cref="ChronoField#MONTH_OF_YEAR month-of-year"/>,
	''' <seealso cref="ChronoField#DAY_OF_MONTH day-of-month"/>, and
	''' <seealso cref="ChronoField#DAY_OF_WEEK ISO day-of-week"/> which are based on the
	''' <seealso cref="ChronoField#EPOCH_DAY epoch-day"/> and the chronology.
	''' The values may not be aligned with the <seealso cref="ChronoField#YEAR_OF_ERA year-of-Era"/>
	''' depending on the Chronology.
	''' <p>A week is defined by:
	''' <ul>
	''' <li>The first day-of-week.
	''' For example, the ISO-8601 standard considers Monday to be the first day-of-week.
	''' <li>The minimal number of days in the first week.
	''' For example, the ISO-8601 standard counts the first week as needing at least 4 days.
	''' </ul>
	''' Together these two values allow a year or month to be divided into weeks.
	''' 
	''' <h3>Week of Month</h3>
	''' One field is used: week-of-month.
	''' The calculation ensures that weeks never overlap a month boundary.
	''' The month is divided into periods where each period starts on the defined first day-of-week.
	''' The earliest period is referred to as week 0 if it has less than the minimal number of days
	''' and week 1 if it has at least the minimal number of days.
	''' 
	''' <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="3" border="0" style="text-align: left; width: 50%;">

	''' </table>
	''' 
	''' <h3>Week of Year</h3>
	''' One field is used: week-of-year.
	''' The calculation ensures that weeks never overlap a year boundary.
	''' The year is divided into periods where each period starts on the defined first day-of-week.
	''' The earliest period is referred to as week 0 if it has less than the minimal number of days
	''' and week 1 if it has at least the minimal number of days.
	''' 
	''' <h3>Week Based Year</h3>
	''' Two fields are used for week-based-year, one for the
	''' <seealso cref="#weekOfWeekBasedYear() week-of-week-based-year"/> and one for
	''' <seealso cref="#weekBasedYear() week-based-year"/>.  In a week-based-year, each week
	''' belongs to only a single year.  Week 1 of a year is the first week that
	''' starts on the first day-of-week and has at least the minimum number of days.
	''' The first and last weeks of a year may contain days from the
	''' previous calendar year or next calendar year respectively.
	'''

		''' This represents the concept of the year where weeks start on a fixed day-of-week,
		''' such as Monday and each week belongs to exactly one year.
		''' This field is typically used with <seealso cref="WeekFields#dayOfWeek()"/> and
		''' <seealso cref="WeekFields#weekOfWeekBasedYear()"/>.
		''' <p>
		''' Week one(1) is the week starting on the <seealso cref="WeekFields#getFirstDayOfWeek"/>
		''' where there are at least <seealso cref="WeekFields#getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()"/> days in the year.
		''' Thus, week one may start before the start of the year.
		''' If the first week starts after the start of the year then the period before
		''' is in the last week of the previous year.
		''' <p>
		''' This field can be used with any calendar system.
		''' <p>
		''' In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a week-based-year,
		''' week-of-year and day-of-week.
		''' <p>
		''' In <seealso cref="ResolverStyle#STRICT strict mode"/>, all three fields are
		''' validated against their range of valid values. The week-of-year field
		''' is validated to ensure that the resulting week-based-year is the
		''' week-based-year requested.
		''' <p>
		''' In <seealso cref="ResolverStyle#SMART smart mode"/>, all three fields are
		''' validated against their range of valid values. The week-of-week-based-year field
		''' is validated from 1 to 53, meaning that the resulting date can be in the
		''' following week-based-year to that specified.
		''' <p>
		''' In <seealso cref="ResolverStyle#LENIENT lenient mode"/>, the year and day-of-week
		''' are validated against the range of valid values. The resulting date is calculated
		''' equivalent to the following three stage approach.
		''' First, create a date on the first day of the first week in the requested week-based-year.
		''' Then take the week-of-week-based-year, subtract one, and add the amount in weeks to the date.
