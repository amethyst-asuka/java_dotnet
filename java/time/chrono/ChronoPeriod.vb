	''' <summary>
	''' A date-based amount of time, such as '3 years, 4 months and 5 days' in an
	''' arbitrary chronology, intended for advanced globalization use cases.
	''' <p>
	''' This interface models a date-based amount of time in a calendar system.
	''' While most calendar systems use years, months and days, some do not.
	''' Therefore, this interface operates solely in terms of a set of supported
	''' units that are defined by the {@code Chronology}.
	''' The set of supported units is fixed for a given chronology.
	''' The amount of a supported unit may be set to zero.
	''' <p>
	''' The period is modeled as a directed amount of time, meaning that individual
	''' parts of the period may be negative.
	''' 
	''' @implSpec
	''' This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
	''' All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
	''' Subclasses should be Serializable wherever possible.
	''' 
	''' @since 1.8
