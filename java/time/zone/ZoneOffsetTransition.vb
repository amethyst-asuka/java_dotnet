	''' <summary>
	''' A transition between two offsets caused by a discontinuity in the local time-line.
	''' <p>
	''' A transition between two offsets is normally the result of a daylight savings cutover.
	''' The discontinuity is normally a gap in spring and an overlap in autumn.
	''' {@code ZoneOffsetTransition} models the transition between the two offsets.
	''' <p>
	''' Gaps occur where there are local date-times that simply do not exist.
	''' An example would be when the offset changes from {@code +03:00} to {@code +04:00}.
	''' This might be described as 'the clocks will move forward one hour tonight at 1am'.
	''' <p>
	''' Overlaps occur where there are local date-times that exist twice.
	''' An example would be when the offset changes from {@code +04:00} to {@code +03:00}.
	''' This might be described as 'the clocks will move back one hour tonight at 2am'.
