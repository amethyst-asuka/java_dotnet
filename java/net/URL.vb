	''' <summary>
	''' Class {@code URL} represents a Uniform Resource
	''' Locator, a pointer to a "resource" on the World
	''' Wide Web. A resource can be something as simple as a file or a
	''' directory, or it can be a reference to a more complicated object,
	''' such as a query to a database or to a search engine. More
	''' information on the types of URLs and their formats can be found at:
	''' <a href=
	''' "http://web.archive.org/web/20051219043731/http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Demo/url-primer.html">
	''' <i>Types of URL</i></a>
	''' <p>
	''' In general, a URL can be broken into several parts. Consider the
	''' following example:
	''' <blockquote><pre>
	'''     http://www.example.com/docs/resource1.html
	''' </pre></blockquote>
	''' <p>
	''' The URL above indicates that the protocol to use is
	''' {@code http} (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and that the
	''' information resides on a host machine named
	''' {@code www.example.com}. The information on that host
	''' machine is named {@code /docs/resource1.html}. The exact
	''' meaning of this name on the host machine is both protocol
	''' dependent and host dependent. The information normally resides in
	''' a file, but it could be generated on the fly. This component of
	''' the URL is called the <i>path</i> component.
	''' <p>
	''' A URL can optionally specify a "port", which is the
	''' port number to which the TCP connection is made on the remote host
	''' machine. If the port is not specified, the default port for
	''' the protocol is used instead. For example, the default port for
	''' {@code http} is {@code 80}. An alternative port could be
	''' specified as:
	''' <blockquote><pre>
	'''     http://www.example.com:1080/docs/resource1.html
	''' </pre></blockquote>
	''' <p>
	''' The syntax of {@code URL} is defined by  <a
	''' href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt"><i>RFC&nbsp;2396: Uniform
	''' Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax</i></a>, amended by <a
	''' href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt"><i>RFC&nbsp;2732: Format for
	''' Literal IPv6 Addresses in URLs</i></a>. The Literal IPv6 address format
	''' also supports scope_ids. The syntax and usage of scope_ids is described
	''' <a href="Inet6Address.html#scoped">here</a>.
	''' <p>
	''' A URL may have appended to it a "fragment", also known
	''' as a "ref" or a "reference". The fragment is indicated by the sharp
	''' sign character "#" followed by more characters. For example,
	''' <blockquote><pre>
	'''     http://java.sun.com/index.html#chapter1
	''' </pre></blockquote>
	''' <p>
	''' This fragment is not technically part of the URL. Rather, it
	''' indicates that after the specified resource is retrieved, the
	''' application is specifically interested in that part of the
	''' document that has the tag {@code chapter1} attached to it. The
	''' meaning of a tag is resource specific.
	''' <p>
	''' An application can also specify a "relative URL",
	''' which contains only enough information to reach the resource
	''' relative to another URL. Relative URLs are frequently used within
	''' HTML pages. For example, if the contents of the URL:
	''' <blockquote><pre>
	'''     http://java.sun.com/index.html
	''' </pre></blockquote>
	''' contained within it the relative URL:
	''' <blockquote><pre>
	'''     FAQ.html
	''' </pre></blockquote>
	''' it would be a shorthand for:
	''' <blockquote><pre>
	'''     http://java.sun.com/FAQ.html
	''' </pre></blockquote>
	''' <p>
	''' The relative URL need not specify all the components of a URL. If
	''' the protocol, host name, or port number is missing, the value is
	''' inherited from the fully specified URL. The file component must be
	''' specified. The optional fragment is not inherited.
	''' <p>
	''' The URL class does not itself encode or decode any URL components
	''' according to the escaping mechanism defined in RFC2396. It is the
	''' responsibility of the caller to encode any fields, which need to be
	''' escaped prior to calling URL, and also to decode any escaped fields,
	''' that are returned from URL. Furthermore, because URL has no knowledge
	''' of URL escaping, it does not recognise equivalence between the encoded
	''' or decoded form of the same URL. For example, the two URLs:<br>
	''' <pre>    http://foo.com/hello world/ and http://foo.com/hello%20world</pre>
	''' would be considered not equal to each other.
	''' <p>
	''' Note, the <seealso cref="java.net.URI"/> class does perform escaping of its
	''' component fields in certain circumstances. The recommended way
	''' to manage the encoding and decoding of URLs is to use <seealso cref="java.net.URI"/>,
	''' and to convert between these two classes using <seealso cref="#toURI()"/> and
	''' <seealso cref="URI#toURL()"/>.
	''' <p>
	''' The <seealso cref="URLEncoder"/> and <seealso cref="URLDecoder"/> classes can also be
	''' used, but only for HTML form encoding, which is not the same
	''' as the encoding scheme defined in RFC2396.
