	''' <summary>
	''' This class represents a socket for sending and receiving datagram packets.
	''' 
	''' <p>A datagram socket is the sending or receiving point for a packet
	''' delivery service. Each packet sent or received on a datagram socket
	''' is individually addressed and routed. Multiple packets sent from
	''' one machine to another may be routed differently, and may arrive in
	''' any order.
	''' 
	''' <p> Where possible, a newly constructed {@code DatagramSocket} has the
	''' <seealso cref="SocketOptions#SO_BROADCAST SO_BROADCAST"/> socket option enabled so as
	''' to allow the transmission of broadcast datagrams. In order to receive
	''' broadcast packets a DatagramSocket should be bound to the wildcard address.
	''' In some implementations, broadcast packets may also be received when
	''' a DatagramSocket is bound to a more specific address.
	''' <p>
	''' Example:
	''' {@code
	'''              DatagramSocket s = new DatagramSocket(null);
	'''              s.bind(new InetSocketAddress(8888));
	''' }
	''' Which is equivalent to:
	''' {@code
	'''              DatagramSocket s = new DatagramSocket(8888);
	''' }
	''' Both cases will create a DatagramSocket able to receive broadcasts on
	''' UDP port 8888.
