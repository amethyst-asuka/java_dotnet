	''' <summary>
	''' This class represents an Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) address.
	''' Defined by <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc790.txt">
	''' <i>RFC&nbsp;790: Assigned Numbers</i></a>,
	''' <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt">
	''' <i>RFC&nbsp;1918: Address Allocation for Private Internets</i></a>,
	''' and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2365.txt"><i>RFC&nbsp;2365:
	''' Administratively Scoped IP Multicast</i></a>
	''' 
	''' <h3> <A NAME="format">Textual representation of IP addresses</a> </h3>
	''' 
	''' Textual representation of IPv4 address used as input to methods
	''' takes one of the following forms:
	''' 
	''' <blockquote><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 summary="layout">
	''' <tr><td>{@code d.d.d.d}</td></tr>
	''' <tr><td>{@code d.d.d}</td></tr>
	''' <tr><td>{@code d.d}</td></tr>
	''' <tr><td>{@code d}</td></tr>
	''' </table></blockquote>
	''' 
	''' <p> When four parts are specified, each is interpreted as a byte of
	''' data and assigned, from left to right, to the four bytes of an IPv4
	''' address.
	''' 
	''' <p> When a three part address is specified, the last part is
	''' interpreted as a 16-bit quantity and placed in the right most two
	''' bytes of the network address. This makes the three part address
	''' format convenient for specifying Class B net- work addresses as
	''' 128.net.host.
	''' 
	''' <p> When a two part address is supplied, the last part is
	''' interpreted as a 24-bit quantity and placed in the right most three
	''' bytes of the network address. This makes the two part address
	''' format convenient for specifying Class A network addresses as
	''' net.host.
	''' 
	''' <p> When only one part is given, the value is stored directly in
	''' the network address without any byte rearrangement.
	''' 
	''' <p> For methods that return a textual representation as output
	''' value, the first form, i.e. a dotted-quad string, is used.
	''' 
	''' <h4> The Scope of a Multicast Address </h4>
	''' 
	''' Historically the IPv4 TTL field in the IP header has doubled as a
	''' multicast scope field: a TTL of 0 means node-local, 1 means
	''' link-local, up through 32 means site-local, up through 64 means
	''' region-local, up through 128 means continent-local, and up through
	''' 255 are global. However, the administrative scoping is preferred.
	''' Please refer to <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2365.txt">
	''' <i>RFC&nbsp;2365: Administratively Scoped IP Multicast</i></a>
	''' @since 1.4
