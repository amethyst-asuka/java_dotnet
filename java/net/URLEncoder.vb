	''' <summary>
	''' Utility class for HTML form encoding. This class contains static methods
	''' for converting a String to the <CODE>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</CODE> MIME
	''' format. For more information about HTML form encoding, consult the HTML
	''' <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/">specification</A>.
	''' 
	''' <p>
	''' When encoding a String, the following rules apply:
	''' 
	''' <ul>
	''' <li>The alphanumeric characters &quot;{@code a}&quot; through
	'''     &quot;{@code z}&quot;, &quot;{@code A}&quot; through
	'''     &quot;{@code Z}&quot; and &quot;{@code 0}&quot;
	'''     through &quot;{@code 9}&quot; remain the same.
	''' <li>The special characters &quot;{@code .}&quot;,
	'''     &quot;{@code -}&quot;, &quot;{@code *}&quot;, and
	'''     &quot;{@code _}&quot; remain the same.
	''' <li>The space character &quot; &nbsp; &quot; is
	'''     converted into a plus sign &quot;{@code +}&quot;.
	''' <li>All other characters are unsafe and are first converted into
	'''     one or more bytes using some encoding scheme. Then each byte is
	'''     represented by the 3-character string
	'''     &quot;<i>{@code %xy}</i>&quot;, where <i>xy</i> is the
	'''     two-digit hexadecimal representation of the byte.
	'''     The recommended encoding scheme to use is UTF-8. However,
	'''     for compatibility reasons, if an encoding is not specified,
	'''     then the default encoding of the platform is used.
	''' </ul>
	''' 
	''' <p>
	''' For example using UTF-8 as the encoding scheme the string &quot;The
	''' string &#252;@foo-bar&quot; would get converted to
	''' &quot;The+string+%C3%BC%40foo-bar&quot; because in UTF-8 the character
	''' &#252; is encoded as two bytes C3 (hex) and BC (hex), and the
	''' character @ is encoded as one byte 40 (hex).

	'         The list of characters that are not encoded has been
	'         * determined as follows:
	'         *
	'         * RFC 2396 states:
	'         * -----
	'         * Data characters that are allowed in a URI but do not have a
	'         * reserved purpose are called unreserved.  These include upper
	'         * and lower case letters, decimal digits, and a limited set of
	'         * punctuation marks and symbols.
	'         *
	'         * unreserved  = alphanum | mark
	'         *
	'         * mark        = "-" | "_" | "." | "!" | "~" | "*" | "'" | "(" | ")"
	'         *
	'         * Unreserved characters can be escaped without changing the
	'         * semantics of the URI, but this should not be done unless the
	'         * URI is being used in a context that does not allow the
	'         * unescaped character to appear.
	'         * -----
	'         *
	'         * It appears that both Netscape and Internet Explorer escape
	'         * all special characters from this list with the exception
	'         * of "-", "_", ".", "*". While it is not clear why they are
	'         * escaping the other characters, perhaps it is safest to
	'         * assume that there might be contexts in which the others
	'         * are unsafe if not escaped. Therefore, we will use the same
	'         * list. It is also noteworthy that this is consistent with
	'         * O'Reilly's "HTML: The Definitive Guide" (page 164).
	'         *
	'         * As a last note, Intenet Explorer does not encode the "@"
	'         * character which is clearly not unreserved according to the
	'         * RFC. We are being consistent with the RFC in this matter,
	'         * as is Netscape.
