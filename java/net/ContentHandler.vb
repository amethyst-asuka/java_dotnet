	''' <summary>
	''' The abstract class {@code ContentHandler} is the superclass
	''' of all classes that read an {@code Object} from a
	''' {@code URLConnection}.
	''' <p>
	''' An application does not generally call the
	''' {@code getContent} method in this class directly. Instead, an
	''' application calls the {@code getContent} method in class
	''' {@code URL} or in {@code URLConnection}.
	''' The application's content handler factory (an instance of a class that
	''' implements the interface {@code ContentHandlerFactory} set
	''' up by a call to {@code setContentHandler}) is
	''' called with a {@code String} giving the MIME type of the
	''' object being received on the socket. The factory returns an
	''' instance of a subclass of {@code ContentHandler}, and its
	''' {@code getContent} method is called to create the object.
	''' <p>
	''' If no content handler could be found, URLConnection will
	''' look for a content handler in a user-defineable set of places.
	''' By default it looks in sun.net.www.content, but users can define a
	''' vertical-bar delimited set of class prefixes to search through in
	''' addition by defining the java.content.handler.pkgs property.
	''' The class name must be of the form:
	''' <pre>
	'''     {package-prefix}.{major}.{minor}
	''' e.g.
	'''     YoyoDyne.experimental.text.plain
	''' </pre>
	''' If the loading of the content handler class would be performed by
	''' a classloader that is outside of the delegation chain of the caller,
	''' the JVM will need the RuntimePermission "getClassLoader".
