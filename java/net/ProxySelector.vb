	''' <summary>
	''' Selects the proxy server to use, if any, when connecting to the
	''' network resource referenced by a URL. A proxy selector is a
	''' concrete sub-class of this class and is registered by invoking the
	''' <seealso cref="java.net.ProxySelector#setDefault setDefault"/> method. The
	''' currently registered proxy selector can be retrieved by calling
	''' <seealso cref="java.net.ProxySelector#getDefault getDefault"/> method.
	''' 
	''' <p> When a proxy selector is registered, for instance, a subclass
	''' of URLConnection class should call the <seealso cref="#select select"/>
	''' method for each URL request so that the proxy selector can decide
	''' if a direct, or proxied connection should be used. The {@link
	''' #select select} method returns an iterator over a collection with
	''' the preferred connection approach.
	''' 
	''' <p> If a connection cannot be established to a proxy (PROXY or
	''' SOCKS) servers then the caller should call the proxy selector's
	''' <seealso cref="#connectFailed connectFailed"/> method to notify the proxy
	''' selector that the proxy server is unavailable. </p>
	''' 
	''' <P>The default proxy selector does enforce a
	''' <a href="doc-files/net-properties.html#Proxies">set of System Properties</a>
	''' related to proxy settings.</P>
