	''' <summary>
	''' This class implements client sockets (also called just
	''' "sockets"). A socket is an endpoint for communication
	''' between two machines.

	''' The actual work of the socket is performed by an instance of the
	''' {@code SocketImpl} class. An application, by changing
	''' the socket factory that creates the socket implementation,
	''' can configure itself to create sockets appropriate to the local
	''' firewall.
