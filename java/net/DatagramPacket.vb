	''' This class represents a datagram packet.

	''' Datagram packets are used to implement a connectionless packet
	''' delivery service. Each message is routed from one machine to
	''' another based solely on information contained within that packet.
	''' Multiple packets sent from one machine to another might be routed
	''' differently, and might arrive in any order. Packet delivery is
	''' not guaranteed.
