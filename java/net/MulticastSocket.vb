	''' <summary>
	''' The multicast datagram socket class is useful for sending
	''' and receiving IP multicast packets.  A MulticastSocket is
	''' a (UDP) DatagramSocket, with additional capabilities for
	''' joining "groups" of other multicast hosts on the internet.
	''' <P>
	''' A multicast group is specified by a class D IP address
	''' and by a standard UDP port number. Class D IP addresses
	''' are in the range <CODE>224.0.0.0</CODE> to <CODE>239.255.255.255</CODE>,
	''' inclusive. The address 224.0.0.0 is reserved and should not be used.
	''' <P>
	''' One would join a multicast group by first creating a MulticastSocket
	''' with the desired port, then invoking the
	''' <CODE>joinGroup(InetAddress groupAddr)</CODE>
	''' method:
	''' <PRE>
	''' // join a Multicast group and send the group salutations
	''' ...
	''' String msg = "Hello";
	''' InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("228.5.6.7");
	''' MulticastSocket s = new MulticastSocket(6789);
	''' s.joinGroup(group);
	''' DatagramPacket hi = new DatagramPacket(msg.getBytes(), msg.length(),
	'''                             group, 6789);
	''' s.send(hi);
	''' // get their responses!
	''' byte[] buf = new byte[1000];
	''' DatagramPacket recv = new DatagramPacket(buf, buf.length);
	''' s.receive(recv);
	''' ...
	''' // OK, I'm done talking - leave the group...
	''' s.leaveGroup(group);
	''' </PRE>
	''' 
	''' When one sends a message to a multicast group, <B>all</B> subscribing
	''' recipients to that host and port receive the message (within the
	''' time-to-live range of the packet, see below).  The socket needn't
	''' be a member of the multicast group to send messages to it.
	''' <P>
	''' When a socket subscribes to a multicast group/port, it receives
	''' datagrams sent by other hosts to the group/port, as do all other
	''' members of the group and port.  A socket relinquishes membership
	''' in a group by the leaveGroup(InetAddress addr) method.  <B>
	''' Multiple MulticastSocket's</B> may subscribe to a multicast group
	''' and port concurrently, and they will all receive group datagrams.
	''' <P>
	''' Currently applets are not allowed to use multicast sockets.
