	''' <summary>
	''' Represents implementations of URLConnection caches. An instance of
	''' such a class can be registered with the system by doing
	''' ResponseCache.setDefault(ResponseCache), and the system will call
	''' this object in order to:
	''' 
	'''    <ul><li>store resource data which has been retrieved from an
	'''            external source into the cache</li>
	'''         <li>try to fetch a requested resource that may have been
	'''            stored in the cache</li>
	'''    </ul>
	''' 
	''' The ResponseCache implementation decides which resources
	''' should be cached, and for how long they should be cached. If a
	''' request resource cannot be retrieved from the cache, then the
	''' protocol handlers will fetch the resource from its original
	''' location.
	''' 
	''' The settings for URLConnection#useCaches controls whether the
	''' protocol is allowed to use a cached response.
	''' 
	''' For more information on HTTP caching, see <a
	''' href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt"><i>RFC&nbsp;2616: Hypertext
	''' Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1</i></a>
