	''' <summary>
	''' A URLConnection with support for HTTP-specific features. See
	''' <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Protocols/"> the spec </A> for
	''' details.
	''' <p>
	''' 
	''' Each HttpURLConnection instance is used to make a single request
	''' but the underlying network connection to the HTTP server may be
	''' transparently shared by other instances. Calling the close() methods
	''' on the InputStream or OutputStream of an HttpURLConnection
	''' after a request may free network resources associated with this
	''' instance but has no effect on any shared persistent connection.
	''' Calling the disconnect() method may close the underlying socket
	''' if a persistent connection is otherwise idle at that time.
	''' 
	''' <P>The HTTP protocol handler has a few settings that can be accessed through
	''' System Properties. This covers
	''' <a href="doc-files/net-properties.html#Proxies">Proxy settings</a> as well as
	''' <a href="doc-files/net-properties.html#MiscHTTP"> various other settings</a>.
	''' </P>
	''' <p>
	''' <b>Security permissions</b>
	''' <p>
	''' If a security manager is installed, and if a method is called which results in an
	''' attempt to open a connection, the caller must possess either:-
	''' <ul><li>a "connect" <seealso cref="SocketPermission"/> to the host/port combination of the
	''' destination URL or</li>
	''' <li>a <seealso cref="URLPermission"/> that permits this request.</li>
	''' </ul><p>
	''' If automatic redirection is enabled, and this request is redirected to another
	''' destination, then the caller must also have permission to connect to the
	''' redirected host/URL.
