	''' <summary>
	''' The class Authenticator represents an object that knows how to obtain
	''' authentication for a network connection.  Usually, it will do this
	''' by prompting the user for information.
	''' <p>
	''' Applications use this class by overriding {@link
	''' #getPasswordAuthentication()} in a sub-class. This method will
	''' typically use the various getXXX() accessor methods to get information
	''' about the entity requesting authentication. It must then acquire a
	''' username and password either by interacting with the user or through
	''' some other non-interactive means. The credentials are then returned
	''' as a <seealso cref="PasswordAuthentication"/> return value.
	''' <p>
	''' An instance of this concrete sub-class is then registered
	''' with the system by calling <seealso cref="#setDefault(Authenticator)"/>.
	''' When authentication is required, the system will invoke one of the
	''' requestPasswordAuthentication() methods which in turn will call the
	''' getPasswordAuthentication() method of the registered object.
	''' <p>
	''' All methods that request authentication have a default implementation
	''' that fails.
