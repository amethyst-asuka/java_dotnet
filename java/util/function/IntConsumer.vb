    ''' <summary>
    ''' Represents an operation that accepts a single {@code int}-valued argument and
    ''' returns no result.  This is the primitive type specialization of
    ''' <seealso cref="Consumer"/> for {@code int}.  Unlike most other functional interfaces,
    ''' {@code IntConsumer} is expected to operate via side-effects.
    ''' 
    ''' <p>This is a <a href="package-summary.html">functional interface</a>
    ''' whose functional method is <seealso cref="#accept(int)"/>.
