	''' <summary>
	''' A <a href="package-summary.html#Reduction">mutable reduction operation</a> that
	''' accumulates input elements into a mutable result container, optionally transforming
	''' the accumulated result into a final representation after all input elements
	''' have been processed.  Reduction operations can be performed either sequentially
	''' or in parallel.
	''' 
	''' <p>Examples of mutable reduction operations include:
	''' accumulating elements into a {@code Collection}; concatenating
	''' strings using a {@code StringBuilder}; computing summary information about
	''' elements such as sum, min, max, or average; computing "pivot table" summaries
	''' such as "maximum valued transaction by seller", etc.  The class <seealso cref="Collectors"/>
	''' provides implementations of many common mutable reductions.
	''' 
	''' <p>A {@code Collector} is specified by four functions that work together to
	''' accumulate entries into a mutable result container, and optionally perform
	''' a final transform on the result.  They are: <ul>
	'''     <li>creation of a new result container (<seealso cref="#supplier()"/>)</li>
	'''     <li>incorporating a new data element into a result container (<seealso cref="#accumulator()"/>)</li>
	'''     <li>combining two result containers into one (<seealso cref="#combiner()"/>)</li>
	'''     <li>performing an optional final transform on the container (<seealso cref="#finisher()"/>)</li>
	''' </ul>
	''' 
	''' <p>Collectors also have a set of characteristics, such as
	''' <seealso cref="Characteristics#CONCURRENT"/>, that provide hints that can be used by a
	''' reduction implementation to provide better performance.
	''' 
	''' <p>A sequential implementation of a reduction using a collector would
	''' create a single result container using the supplier function, and invoke the
	''' accumulator function once for each input element.  A parallel implementation
	''' would partition the input, create a result container for each partition,
	''' accumulate the contents of each partition into a subresult for that partition,
	''' and then use the combiner function to merge the subresults into a combined
	''' result.
	''' 
	''' <p>To ensure that sequential and parallel executions produce equivalent
	''' results, the collector functions must satisfy an <em>identity</em> and an
	''' <a href="package-summary.html#Associativity">associativity</a> constraints.
	''' 
	''' <p>The identity constraint says that for any partially accumulated result,
	''' combining it with an empty result container must produce an equivalent
	''' result.  That is, for a partially accumulated result {@code a} that is the
	''' result of any series of accumulator and combiner invocations, {@code a} must
	''' be equivalent to {@code combiner.apply(a, supplier.get())}.
	''' 
	''' <p>The associativity constraint says that splitting the computation must
	''' produce an equivalent result.  That is, for any input elements {@code t1}
	''' and {@code t2}, the results {@code r1} and {@code r2} in the computation
	''' below must be equivalent:
	''' <pre>{@code
	'''     A a1 = supplier.get();
	'''     accumulator.accept(a1, t1);
	'''     accumulator.accept(a1, t2);
	'''     R r1 = finisher.apply(a1);  // result without splitting
	''' 
	'''     A a2 = supplier.get();
	'''     accumulator.accept(a2, t1);
	'''     A a3 = supplier.get();
	'''     accumulator.accept(a3, t2);
	'''     R r2 = finisher.apply(combiner.apply(a2, a3));  // result with splitting
	''' } </pre>
	''' 
	''' <p>For collectors that do not have the {@code UNORDERED} characteristic,
	''' two accumulated results {@code a1} and {@code a2} are equivalent if
	''' {@code finisher.apply(a1).equals(finisher.apply(a2))}.  For unordered
	''' collectors, equivalence is relaxed to allow for non-equality related to
	''' differences in order.  (For example, an unordered collector that accumulated
	''' elements to a {@code List} would consider two lists equivalent if they
	''' contained the same elements, ignoring order.)
	''' 
	''' <p>Libraries that implement reduction based on {@code Collector}, such as
	''' <seealso cref="Stream#collect(Collector)"/>, must adhere to the following constraints:
	''' <ul>
	'''     <li>The first argument passed to the accumulator function, both
	'''     arguments passed to the combiner function, and the argument passed to the
	'''     finisher function must be the result of a previous invocation of the
	'''     result supplier, accumulator, or combiner functions.</li>
	'''     <li>The implementation should not do anything with the result of any of
	'''     the result supplier, accumulator, or combiner functions other than to
	'''     pass them again to the accumulator, combiner, or finisher functions,
	'''     or return them to the caller of the reduction operation.</li>
	'''     <li>If a result is passed to the combiner or finisher
	'''     function, and the same object is not returned from that function, it is
	'''     never used again.</li>
	'''     <li>Once a result is passed to the combiner or finisher function, it
	'''     is never passed to the accumulator function again.</li>
	'''     <li>For non-concurrent collectors, any result returned from the result
	'''     supplier, accumulator, or combiner functions must be serially
	'''     thread-confined.  This enables collection to occur in parallel without
	'''     the {@code Collector} needing to implement any additional synchronization.
	'''     The reduction implementation must manage that the input is properly
	'''     partitioned, that partitions are processed in isolation, and combining
	'''     happens only after accumulation is complete.</li>
	'''     <li>For concurrent collectors, an implementation is free to (but not
	'''     required to) implement reduction concurrently.  A concurrent reduction
	'''     is one where the accumulator function is called concurrently from
	'''     multiple threads, using the same concurrently-modifiable result container,
	'''     rather than keeping the result isolated during accumulation.
	'''     A concurrent reduction should only be applied if the collector has the
	'''     <seealso cref="Characteristics#UNORDERED"/> characteristics or if the
	'''     originating data is unordered.</li>
	''' </ul>
	''' 
	''' <p>In addition to the predefined implementations in <seealso cref="Collectors"/>, the
	''' static factory methods <seealso cref="#of(Supplier, BiConsumer, BinaryOperator, Characteristics...)"/>
	''' can be used to construct collectors.  For example, you could create a collector
	''' that accumulates widgets into a {@code TreeSet} with:
	''' 
	''' <pre>{@code
	'''     Collector<Widget, ?, TreeSet<Widget>> intoSet =
	'''         Collector.of(TreeSet::new, TreeSet::add,
	'''                      (left, right) -> { left.addAll(right); return left; });
	''' }</pre>
	''' 
	''' (This behavior is also implemented by the predefined collector
	''' <seealso cref="Collectors#toCollection(Supplier)"/>).
	''' 
	''' @apiNote
	''' Performing a reduction operation with a {@code Collector} should produce a
	''' result equivalent to:
	''' <pre>{@code
	'''     R container = collector.supplier().get();
	'''     for (T t : data)
	'''         collector.accumulator().accept(container, t);
	'''     return collector.finisher().apply(container);
	''' }</pre>
	''' 
	''' <p>However, the library is free to partition the input, perform the reduction
	''' on the partitions, and then use the combiner function to combine the partial
	''' results to achieve a parallel reduction.  (Depending on the specific reduction
	''' operation, this may perform better or worse, depending on the relative cost
	''' of the accumulator and combiner functions.)
	''' 
	''' <p>Collectors are designed to be <em>composed</em>; many of the methods
	''' in <seealso cref="Collectors"/> are functions that take a collector and produce
	''' a new collector.  For example, given the following collector that computes
	''' the sum of the salaries of a stream of employees:
	''' 
	''' <pre>{@code
	'''     Collector<Employee, ?, Integer> summingSalaries
	'''         = Collectors.summingInt(Employee::getSalary))
	''' }</pre>
	''' 
	''' If we wanted to create a collector to tabulate the sum of salaries by
	''' department, we could reuse the "sum of salaries" logic using
	''' <seealso cref="Collectors#groupingBy(Function, Collector)"/>:
	''' 
	''' <pre>{@code
	'''     Collector<Employee, ?, Map<Department, Integer>> summingSalariesByDept
	'''         = Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getDepartment, summingSalaries);
	''' }</pre>
