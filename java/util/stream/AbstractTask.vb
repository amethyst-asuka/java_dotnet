	''' <summary>
	''' Abstract base class for most fork-join tasks used to implement stream ops.
	''' Manages splitting logic, tracking of child tasks, and intermediate results.
	''' Each task is associated with a <seealso cref="Spliterator"/> that describes the portion
	''' of the input associated with the subtree rooted at this task.
	''' Tasks may be leaf nodes (which will traverse the elements of
	''' the {@code Spliterator}) or internal nodes (which split the
	''' {@code Spliterator} into multiple child tasks).
	''' 
	''' @implNote
	''' <p>This class is based on <seealso cref="CountedCompleter"/>, a form of fork-join task
	''' where each task has a semaphore-like count of uncompleted children, and the
	''' task is implicitly completed and notified when its last child completes.
	''' Internal node tasks will likely override the {@code onCompletion} method from
	''' {@code CountedCompleter} to merge the results from child tasks into the
	''' current task's result.
	''' 
	''' <p>Splitting and setting up the child task links is done by {@code compute()}
	''' for internal nodes.  At {@code compute()} time for leaf nodes, it is
	''' guaranteed that the parent's child-related fields (including sibling links
	''' for the parent's children) will be set up for all children.
	''' 
	''' <p>For example, a task that performs a reduce would override {@code doLeaf()}
	''' to perform a reduction on that leaf node's chunk using the
	''' {@code Spliterator}, and override {@code onCompletion()} to merge the results
	''' of the child tasks for internal nodes:
	''' 
	''' <pre>{@code
	'''     protected S doLeaf() {
	'''         spliterator.forEach(...);
	'''         return localReductionResult;
	'''     }
	''' 
	'''     public  Sub  onCompletion(CountedCompleter caller) {
	'''         if (!isLeaf()) {
	'''             ReduceTask<P_IN, P_OUT, T, R> child = children;
	'''             R result = child.getLocalResult();
	'''             child = child.nextSibling;
	'''             for (; child != null; child = child.nextSibling)
	'''                 result = combine(result, child.getLocalResult());
	'''             setLocalResult(result);
	'''         }
	'''     }
	''' }</pre>
	''' 
	''' <p>Serialization is not supported as there is no intention to serialize
	''' tasks managed by stream ops.
