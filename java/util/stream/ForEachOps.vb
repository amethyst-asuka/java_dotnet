	''' Factory for creating instances of {@code TerminalOp} that perform an
	''' action for every element of a stream.  Supported variants include unordered
	''' traversal (elements are provided to the {@code Consumer} as soon as they are
	''' available), and ordered traversal (elements are provided to the
	''' {@code Consumer} in encounter order.)

	''' <p>Elements are provided to the {@code Consumer} on whatever thread and
	''' whatever order they become available.  For ordered traversals, it is

	''' subsequent elements in the encounter order.
	''' 
	''' <p>Exceptions occurring as a result of sending an element to the
	''' {@code Consumer} will be relayed to the caller and traversal will be
	''' prematurely terminated.

	'        
	'         * Our goal is to ensure that the elements associated with a task are
	'         * processed according to an in-order traversal of the computation tree.
	'         * We use completion counts for representing these dependencies, so that
	'         * a task does not complete until all the tasks preceding it in this
	'         * order complete.  We use the "completion map" to associate the next
	'         * task in this order for any left child.  We increase the pending count
	'         * of any node on the right side of such a mapping by one to indicate
	'         * its dependency, and when a node on the left side of such a mapping
	'         * completes, it decrements the pending count of its corresponding right
	'         * side.  As the computation tree is expanded by splitting, we must
	'         * atomically update the mappings to maintain the invariant that the
	'         * completion map maps left children to the next node in the in-order
	'         * traversal.
	'         *
	'         * Take, for example, the following computation tree of tasks:
	'         *
	'         *       a
	'         *      / \
	'         *     b   c
	'         *    / \ / \
	'         *   d  e f  g
	'         *
	'         * The complete map will contain (not necessarily all at the same time)
	'         * the following associations:
	'         *
	'         *   d -> e
	'         *   b -> f
	'         *   f -> g
	'         *
	'         * Tasks e, f, g will have their pending counts increased by 1.
	'         *
	'         * The following relationships hold:
	'         *
	'         *   - completion of d "happens-before" e;
	'         *   - completion of d and e "happens-before b;
	'         *   - completion of b "happens-before" f; and
	'         *   - completion of f "happens-before" g
	'         *
	'         * Thus overall the "happens-before" relationship holds for the
	'         * reporting of elements, covered by tasks d, e, f and g, as specified
	'         * by the forEachOrdered operation.
