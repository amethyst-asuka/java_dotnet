	''' <summary>
	''' A sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate
	''' operations.  The following example illustrates an aggregate operation using
	''' <seealso cref="Stream"/> and <seealso cref="IntStream"/>:
	''' 
	''' <pre>{@code
	'''     int sum = widgets.stream()
	'''                      .filter(w -> w.getColor() == RED)
	'''                      .mapToInt(w -> w.getWeight())
	'''                      .sum();
	''' }</pre>
	''' 
	''' In this example, {@code widgets} is a {@code Collection<Widget>}.  We create
	''' a stream of {@code Widget} objects via <seealso cref="Collection#stream Collection.stream()"/>,
	''' filter it to produce a stream containing only the red widgets, and then
	''' transform it into a stream of {@code int} values representing the weight of
	''' each red widget. Then this stream is summed to produce a total weight.
	''' 
	''' <p>In addition to {@code Stream}, which is a stream of object references,
	''' there are primitive specializations for <seealso cref="IntStream"/>, <seealso cref="LongStream"/>,
	''' and <seealso cref="DoubleStream"/>, all of which are referred to as "streams" and
	''' conform to the characteristics and restrictions described here.
	''' 
	''' <p>To perform a computation, stream
	''' <a href="package-summary.html#StreamOps">operations</a> are composed into a
	''' <em>stream pipeline</em>.  A stream pipeline consists of a source (which
	''' might be an array, a collection, a generator function, an I/O channel,
	''' etc), zero or more <em>intermediate operations</em> (which transform a
	''' stream into another stream, such as <seealso cref="Stream#filter(Predicate)"/>), and a
	''' <em>terminal operation</em> (which produces a result or side-effect, such
	''' as <seealso cref="Stream#count()"/> or <seealso cref="Stream#forEach(Consumer)"/>).
	''' Streams are lazy; computation on the source data is only performed when the
	''' terminal operation is initiated, and source elements are consumed only
	''' as needed.
	''' 
	''' <p>Collections and streams, while bearing some superficial similarities,
	''' have different goals.  Collections are primarily concerned with the efficient
	''' management of, and access to, their elements.  By contrast, streams do not
	''' provide a means to directly access or manipulate their elements, and are
	''' instead concerned with declaratively describing their source and the
	''' computational operations which will be performed in aggregate on that source.
	''' However, if the provided stream operations do not offer the desired
	''' functionality, the <seealso cref="#iterator()"/> and <seealso cref="#spliterator()"/> operations
	''' can be used to perform a controlled traversal.
	''' 
	''' <p>A stream pipeline, like the "widgets" example above, can be viewed as
	''' a <em>query</em> on the stream source.  Unless the source was explicitly
	''' designed for concurrent modification (such as a <seealso cref="ConcurrentHashMap"/>),
	''' unpredictable or erroneous behavior may result from modifying the stream
	''' source while it is being queried.
	''' 
	''' <p>Most stream operations accept parameters that describe user-specified
	''' behavior, such as the lambda expression {@code w -> w.getWeight()} passed to
	''' {@code mapToInt} in the example above.  To preserve correct behavior,
	''' these <em>behavioral parameters</em>:
	''' <ul>
	''' <li>must be <a href="package-summary.html#NonInterference">non-interfering</a>
	''' (they do not modify the stream source); and</li>
	''' <li>in most cases must be <a href="package-summary.html#Statelessness">stateless</a>
	''' (their result should not depend on any state that might change during execution
	''' of the stream pipeline).</li>
	''' </ul>
	''' 
	''' <p>Such parameters are always instances of a
	''' <a href="../function/package-summary.html">functional interface</a> such
	''' as <seealso cref="java.util.function.Function"/>, and are often lambda expressions or
	''' method references.  Unless otherwise specified these parameters must be
	''' <em>non-null</em>.
	''' 
	''' <p>A stream should be operated on (invoking an intermediate or terminal stream
	''' operation) only once.  This rules out, for example, "forked" streams, where
	''' the same source feeds two or more pipelines, or multiple traversals of the
	''' same stream.  A stream implementation may throw <seealso cref="IllegalStateException"/>
	''' if it detects that the stream is being reused. However, since some stream
	''' operations may return their receiver rather than a new stream object, it may
	''' not be possible to detect reuse in all cases.
	''' 
	''' <p>Streams have a <seealso cref="#close()"/> method and implement <seealso cref="AutoCloseable"/>,
	''' but nearly all stream instances do not actually need to be closed after use.
	''' Generally, only streams whose source is an IO channel (such as those returned
	''' by <seealso cref="Files#lines(Path, Charset)"/>) will require closing.  Most streams
	''' are backed by collections, arrays, or generating functions, which require no
	''' special resource management.  (If a stream does require closing, it can be
	''' declared as a resource in a {@code try}-with-resources statement.)
	''' 
	''' <p>Stream pipelines may execute either sequentially or in
	''' <a href="package-summary.html#Parallelism">parallel</a>.  This
	''' execution mode is a property of the stream.  Streams are created
	''' with an initial choice of sequential or parallel execution.  (For example,
	''' <seealso cref="Collection#stream() Collection.stream()"/> creates a sequential stream,
	''' and <seealso cref="Collection#parallelStream() Collection.parallelStream()"/> creates
	''' a parallel one.)  This choice of execution mode may be modified by the
	''' <seealso cref="#sequential()"/> or <seealso cref="#parallel()"/> methods, and may be queried with
	''' the <seealso cref="#isParallel()"/> method.
