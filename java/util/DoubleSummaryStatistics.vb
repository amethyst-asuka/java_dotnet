	''' <summary>
	''' A state object for collecting statistics such as count, min, max, sum, and
	''' average.
	''' 
	''' <p>This class is designed to work with (though does not require)
	''' <seealso cref="java.util.stream streams"/>. For example, you can compute
	''' summary statistics on a stream of doubles with:
	''' <pre> {@code
	''' DoubleSummaryStatistics stats = doubleStream.collect(DoubleSummaryStatistics::new,
	'''                                                      DoubleSummaryStatistics::accept,
	'''                                                      DoubleSummaryStatistics::combine);
	''' }</pre>
	''' 
	''' <p>{@code DoubleSummaryStatistics} can be used as a
	''' <seealso cref="java.util.stream.Stream#collect(Collector) reduction"/>
	''' target for a <seealso cref="java.util.stream.Stream stream"/>. For example:
	''' 
	''' <pre> {@code
	''' DoubleSummaryStatistics stats = people.stream()
	'''     .collect(Collectors.summarizingDouble(Person::getWeight));
	''' }</pre>
	''' 
	''' This computes, in a single pass, the count of people, as well as the minimum,
	''' maximum, sum, and average of their weights.
	''' 
	''' @implNote This implementation is not thread safe. However, it is safe to use
	''' {@link java.util.stream.Collectors#summarizingDouble(java.util.function.ToDoubleFunction)
	''' Collectors.toDoubleStatistics()} on a parallel stream, because the parallel
	''' implementation of <seealso cref="java.util.stream.Stream#collect Stream.collect()"/>
	''' provides the necessary partitioning, isolation, and merging of results for
	''' safe and efficient parallel execution.
	''' @since 1.8
