	''' This is a near duplicate of <seealso cref="TimSort"/>, modified for use with
	''' arrays of objects that implement <seealso cref="Comparable"/>, instead of using
	''' explicit comparators.
	''' 
	''' <p>If you are using an optimizing VM, you may find that ComparableTimSort
	''' offers no performance benefit over TimSort in conjunction with a
	''' comparator that simply returns {@code ((Comparable)first).compareTo(Second)}.
	''' If this is the case, you are better off deleting ComparableTimSort to
	''' eliminate the code duplication.  (See Arrays.java for details.)
