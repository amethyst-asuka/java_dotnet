	''' <summary>
	''' An engine that performs match operations on a {@link java.lang.CharSequence
	''' character sequence} by interpreting a <seealso cref="Pattern"/>.
	''' 
	''' <p> A matcher is created from a pattern by invoking the pattern's {@link
	''' Pattern#matcher matcher} method.  Once created, a matcher can be used to
	''' perform three different kinds of match operations:
	''' 
	''' <ul>
	''' 
	'''   <li><p> The <seealso cref="#matches matches"/> method attempts to match the entire
	'''   input sequence against the pattern.  </p></li>
	''' 
	'''   <li><p> The <seealso cref="#lookingAt lookingAt"/> method attempts to match the
	'''   input sequence, starting at the beginning, against the pattern.  </p></li>
	''' 
	'''   <li><p> The <seealso cref="#find find"/> method scans the input sequence looking for
	'''   the next subsequence that matches the pattern.  </p></li>
	''' 
	''' </ul>
	''' 
	''' <p> Each of these methods returns a boolean indicating success or failure.
	''' More information about a successful match can be obtained by querying the
	''' state of the matcher.
	''' 
	''' <p> A matcher finds matches in a subset of its input called the
	''' <i>region</i>. By default, the region contains all of the matcher's input.
	''' The region can be modified via the<seealso cref="#region region"/> method and queried
	''' via the <seealso cref="#regionStart regionStart"/> and <seealso cref="#regionEnd regionEnd"/>
	''' methods. The way that the region boundaries interact with some pattern
	''' constructs can be changed. See {@link #useAnchoringBounds
	''' useAnchoringBounds} and <seealso cref="#useTransparentBounds useTransparentBounds"/>
	''' for more details.
	''' 
	''' <p> This class also defines methods for replacing matched subsequences with
	''' new strings whose contents can, if desired, be computed from the match
	''' result.  The <seealso cref="#appendReplacement appendReplacement"/> and {@link
	''' #appendTail appendTail} methods can be used in tandem in order to collect
	''' the result into an existing string buffer, or the more convenient {@link
	''' #replaceAll replaceAll} method can be used to create a string in which every
	''' matching subsequence in the input sequence is replaced.
	''' 
	''' <p> The explicit state of a matcher includes the start and end indices of
	''' the most recent successful match.  It also includes the start and end
	''' indices of the input subsequence captured by each <a
	''' href="Pattern.html#cg">capturing group</a> in the pattern as well as a total
	''' count of such subsequences.  As a convenience, methods are also provided for
	''' returning these captured subsequences in string form.
	''' 
	''' <p> The explicit state of a matcher is initially undefined; attempting to
	''' query any part of it before a successful match will cause an {@link
	''' IllegalStateException} to be thrown.  The explicit state of a matcher is
	''' recomputed by every match operation.
	''' 
	''' <p> The implicit state of a matcher includes the input character sequence as
	''' well as the <i>append position</i>, which is initially zero and is updated
	''' by the <seealso cref="#appendReplacement appendReplacement"/> method.
	''' 
	''' <p> A matcher may be reset explicitly by invoking its <seealso cref="#reset()"/>
	''' method or, if a new input sequence is desired, its {@link
	''' #reset(java.lang.CharSequence) reset(CharSequence)} method.  Resetting a
	''' matcher discards its explicit state information and sets the append position
	''' to zero.
	''' 
	''' <p> Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent
	''' threads. </p>

		''' <p> This method performs the following actions: </p>
		''' 
		''' <ol>
		''' 
		'''   <li><p> It reads characters from the input sequence, starting at the
		'''   append position, and appends them to the given string buffer.  It
		'''   stops after reading the last character preceding the previous match,
		'''   that is, the character at index {@link
		'''   #start()}&nbsp;<tt>-</tt>&nbsp;<tt>1</tt>.  </p></li>
		''' 
		'''   <li><p> It appends the given replacement string to the string buffer.
		'''   </p></li>
		''' 
		'''   <li><p> It sets the append position of this matcher to the index of
		'''   the last character matched, plus one, that is, to <seealso cref="#end()"/>.
		'''   </p></li>
		''' 
		''' </ol>
		''' 
		''' <p> The replacement string may contain references to subsequences
		''' captured during the previous match: Each occurrence of
		''' <tt>${</tt><i>name</i><tt>}</tt> or <tt>$</tt><i>g</i>
		''' will be replaced by the result of evaluating the corresponding
		''' <seealso cref="#group(String) group(name)"/> or <seealso cref="#group(int) group(g)"/>
		''' respectively. For  <tt>$</tt><i>g</i>,
		''' the first number after the <tt>$</tt> is always treated as part of
		''' the group reference. Subsequent numbers are incorporated into g if
		''' they would form a legal group reference. Only the numerals '0'
		''' through '9' are considered as potential components of the group
		''' reference. If the second group matched the string <tt>"foo"</tt>, for
		''' example, then passing the replacement string <tt>"$2bar"</tt> would
		''' cause <tt>"foobar"</tt> to be appended to the string buffer. A dollar
		''' sign (<tt>$</tt>) may be included as a literal in the replacement
		''' string by preceding it with a backslash (<tt>\$</tt>).
		''' 
		''' <p> Note that backslashes (<tt>\</tt>) and dollar signs (<tt>$</tt>) in
		''' the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it
		''' were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be
		''' treated as references to captured subsequences as described above, and
		''' backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement
		''' string.
		''' 
		''' <p> This method is intended to be used in a loop together with the
