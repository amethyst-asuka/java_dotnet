	''' <summary>
	''' <code>PropertyResourceBundle</code> is a concrete subclass of
	''' <code>ResourceBundle</code> that manages resources for a locale
	''' using a set of static strings from a property file. See
	''' <seealso cref="ResourceBundle ResourceBundle"/> for more information about resource
	''' bundles.
	''' 
	''' <p>
	''' Unlike other types of resource bundle, you don't subclass
	''' <code>PropertyResourceBundle</code>.  Instead, you supply properties
	''' files containing the resource data.  <code>ResourceBundle.getBundle</code>
	''' will automatically look for the appropriate properties file and create a
	''' <code>PropertyResourceBundle</code> that refers to it. See
	''' <seealso cref="ResourceBundle#getBundle(java.lang.String, java.util.Locale, java.lang.ClassLoader) ResourceBundle.getBundle"/>
	''' for a complete description of the search and instantiation strategy.
	''' 
	''' <p>
	''' The following <a name="sample">example</a> shows a member of a resource
	''' bundle family with the base name "MyResources".
	''' The text defines the bundle "MyResources_de",
	''' the German member of the bundle family.
	''' This member is based on <code>PropertyResourceBundle</code>, and the text
	''' therefore is the content of the file "MyResources_de.properties"
	''' (a related <a href="ListResourceBundle.html#sample">example</a> shows
	''' how you can add bundles to this family that are implemented as subclasses
	''' of <code>ListResourceBundle</code>).
	''' The keys in this example are of the form "s1" etc. The actual
	''' keys are entirely up to your choice, so long as they are the same as
	''' the keys you use in your program to retrieve the objects from the bundle.
	''' Keys are case-sensitive.
	''' <blockquote>
	''' <pre>
	''' # MessageFormat pattern
	''' s1=Die Platte \"{1}\" enth&auml;lt {0}.
	''' 
	''' # location of {0} in pattern
	''' s2=1
	''' 
	''' # sample disk name
	''' s3=Meine Platte
	''' 
	''' # first ChoiceFormat choice
	''' s4=keine Dateien
	''' 
	''' # second ChoiceFormat choice
	''' s5=eine Datei
	''' 
	''' # third ChoiceFormat choice
	''' s6={0,number} Dateien
	''' 
	''' # sample date
	''' s7=3. M&auml;rz 1996
	''' </pre>
	''' </blockquote>
	''' 
	''' <p>
	''' The implementation of a {@code PropertyResourceBundle} subclass must be
	''' thread-safe if it's simultaneously used by multiple threads. The default
	''' implementations of the non-abstract methods in this class are thread-safe.
	''' 
	''' <p>
	''' <strong>Note:</strong> PropertyResourceBundle can be constructed either
	''' from an InputStream or a Reader, which represents a property file.
	''' Constructing a PropertyResourceBundle instance from an InputStream requires
	''' that the input stream be encoded in ISO-8859-1.  In that case, characters
	''' that cannot be represented in ISO-8859-1 encoding must be represented by Unicode Escapes
	''' as defined in section 3.3 of
	''' <cite>The Java&trade; Language Specification</cite>
	''' whereas the other constructor which takes a Reader does not have that limitation.
