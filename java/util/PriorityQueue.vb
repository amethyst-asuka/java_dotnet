	''' <summary>
	''' An unbounded priority <seealso cref="Queue queue"/> based on a priority heap.
	''' The elements of the priority queue are ordered according to their
	''' <seealso cref="Comparable natural ordering"/>, or by a <seealso cref="Comparator"/>
	''' provided at queue construction time, depending on which constructor is
	''' used.  A priority queue does not permit {@code null} elements.
	''' A priority queue relying on natural ordering also does not permit
	''' insertion of non-comparable objects (doing so may result in
	''' {@code ClassCastException}).
	''' 
	''' <p>The <em>head</em> of this queue is the <em>least</em> element
	''' with respect to the specified ordering.  If multiple elements are
	''' tied for least value, the head is one of those elements -- ties are
	''' broken arbitrarily.  The queue retrieval operations {@code poll},
	''' {@code remove}, {@code peek}, and {@code element} access the
	''' element at the head of the queue.
	''' 
	''' <p>A priority queue is unbounded, but has an internal
	''' <i>capacity</i> governing the size of an array used to store the
	''' elements on the queue.  It is always at least as large as the queue
	''' size.  As elements are added to a priority queue, its capacity
	''' grows automatically.  The details of the growth policy are not
	''' specified.
	''' 
	''' <p>This class and its iterator implement all of the
	''' <em>optional</em> methods of the <seealso cref="Collection"/> and {@link
	''' Iterator} interfaces.  The Iterator provided in method {@link
	''' #iterator()} is <em>not</em> guaranteed to traverse the elements of
	''' the priority queue in any particular order. If you need ordered
	''' traversal, consider using {@code Arrays.sort(pq.toArray())}.
	''' 
	''' <p><strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
	''' Multiple threads should not access a {@code PriorityQueue}
	''' instance concurrently if any of the threads modifies the queue.
	''' Instead, use the thread-safe {@link
	''' java.util.concurrent.PriorityBlockingQueue} class.
	''' 
	''' <p>Implementation note: this implementation provides
	''' O(log(n)) time for the enqueuing and dequeuing methods
	''' ({@code offer}, {@code poll}, {@code remove()} and {@code add});
	''' linear time for the {@code remove(Object)} and {@code contains(Object)}
	''' methods; and constant time for the retrieval methods
	''' ({@code peek}, {@code element}, and {@code size}).
	'''
