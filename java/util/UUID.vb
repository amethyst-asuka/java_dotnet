	''' <summary>
	''' A class that represents an immutable universally unique identifier (UUID).
	''' A UUID represents a 128-bit value.
	''' 
	''' <p> There exist different variants of these global identifiers.  The methods
	''' of this class are for manipulating the Leach-Salz variant, although the
	''' constructors allow the creation of any variant of UUID (described below).
	''' 
	''' <p> The layout of a variant 2 (Leach-Salz) UUID is as follows:
	''' 
	''' The most significant long consists of the following unsigned fields:
	''' <pre>
	''' 0xFFFFFFFF00000000 time_low
	''' 0x00000000FFFF0000 time_mid
	''' 0x000000000000F000 version
	''' 0x0000000000000FFF time_hi
	''' </pre>
	''' The least significant long consists of the following unsigned fields:
	''' <pre>
	''' 0xC000000000000000 variant
	''' 0x3FFF000000000000 clock_seq
	''' 0x0000FFFFFFFFFFFF node
	''' </pre>
	''' 
	''' <p> The variant field contains a value which identifies the layout of the
	''' {@code UUID}.  The bit layout described above is valid only for a {@code
	''' UUID} with a variant value of 2, which indicates the Leach-Salz variant.
	''' 
	''' <p> The version field holds a value that describes the type of this {@code
	''' UUID}.  There are four different basic types of UUIDs: time-based, DCE
	''' security, name-based, and randomly generated UUIDs.  These types have a
	''' version value of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.
	''' 
	''' <p> For more information including algorithms used to create {@code UUID}s,
	''' see <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt"> <i>RFC&nbsp;4122: A
	''' Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace</i></a>, section 4.2
