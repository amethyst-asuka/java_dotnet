	''' <summary>
	''' The {@code Properties} class represents a persistent set of
	''' properties. The {@code Properties} can be saved to a stream
	''' or loaded from a stream. Each key and its corresponding value in
	''' the property list is a string.
	''' <p>
	''' A property list can contain another property list as its
	''' "defaults"; this second property list is searched if
	''' the property key is not found in the original property list.
	''' <p>
	''' Because {@code Properties} inherits from {@code Hashtable}, the
	''' {@code put} and {@code putAll} methods can be applied to a
	''' {@code Properties} object.  Their use is strongly discouraged as they
	''' allow the caller to insert entries whose keys or values are not
	''' {@code Strings}.  The {@code setProperty} method should be used
	''' instead.  If the {@code store} or {@code save} method is called
	''' on a "compromised" {@code Properties} object that contains a
	''' non-{@code String} key or value, the call will fail. Similarly,
	''' the call to the {@code propertyNames} or {@code list} method
	''' will fail if it is called on a "compromised" {@code Properties}
	''' object that contains a non-{@code String} key.
	''' 
	''' <p>
	''' The <seealso cref="#load(java.io.Reader) load(Reader)"/> <tt>/</tt>
	''' <seealso cref="#store(java.io.Writer, java.lang.String) store(Writer, String)"/>
	''' methods load and store properties from and to a character based stream
	''' in a simple line-oriented format specified below.
	''' 
	''' The <seealso cref="#load(java.io.InputStream) load(InputStream)"/> <tt>/</tt>
	''' <seealso cref="#store(java.io.OutputStream, java.lang.String) store(OutputStream, String)"/>
	''' methods work the same way as the load(Reader)/store(Writer, String) pair, except
	''' the input/output stream is encoded in ISO 8859-1 character encoding.
	''' Characters that cannot be directly represented in this encoding can be written using
	''' Unicode escapes as defined in section 3.3 of
	''' <cite>The Java&trade; Language Specification</cite>;
	''' only a single 'u' character is allowed in an escape
	''' sequence. The native2ascii tool can be used to convert property files to and
	''' from other character encodings.
	''' 
	''' <p> The <seealso cref="#loadFromXML(InputStream)"/> and {@link
	''' #storeToXML(OutputStream, String, String)} methods load and store properties
	''' in a simple XML format.  By default the UTF-8 character encoding is used,
	''' however a specific encoding may be specified if required. Implementations
	''' are required to support UTF-8 and UTF-16 and may support other encodings.
	''' An XML properties document has the following DOCTYPE declaration:
	''' 
	''' <pre>
	''' &lt;!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/properties.dtd"&gt;
	''' </pre>
	''' Note that the system URI (http://java.sun.com/dtd/properties.dtd) is
	''' <i>not</i> accessed when exporting or importing properties; it merely
	''' serves as a string to uniquely identify the DTD, which is:
	''' <pre>
	'''    &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
	''' 
	'''    &lt;!-- DTD for properties --&gt;
	''' 
	'''    &lt;!ELEMENT properties ( comment?, entry* ) &gt;
	''' 
	'''    &lt;!ATTLIST properties version CDATA #FIXED "1.0"&gt;
	''' 
	'''    &lt;!ELEMENT comment (#PCDATA) &gt;
	''' 
	'''    &lt;!ELEMENT entry (#PCDATA) &gt;

		''' <summary>
		''' Reads a property list (key and element pairs) from the input
		''' character stream in a simple line-oriented format.
		''' <p>
		''' Properties are processed in terms of lines. There are two
		''' kinds of line, <i>natural lines</i> and <i>logical lines</i>.
		''' A natural line is defined as a line of
		''' characters that is terminated either by a set of line terminator
		''' characters ({@code \n} or {@code \r} or {@code \r\n})
		''' or by the end of the stream. A natural line may be either a blank line,
		''' a comment line, or hold all or some of a key-element pair. A logical
		''' line holds all the data of a key-element pair, which may be spread
		''' out across several adjacent natural lines by escaping
		''' the line terminator sequence with a backslash character
		''' {@code \}.  Note that a comment line cannot be extended
		''' in this manner; every natural line that is a comment must have
		''' its own comment indicator, as described below. Lines are read from
		''' input until the end of the stream is reached.
		''' 
		''' <p>
		''' A natural line that contains only white space characters is
		''' considered blank and is ignored.  A comment line has an ASCII
		''' {@code '#'} or {@code '!'} as its first non-white
		''' space character; comment lines are also ignored and do not
		''' encode key-element information.  In addition to line
		''' terminators, this format considers the characters space
		''' ({@code ' '}, {@code '\u005Cu0020'}), tab
		''' ({@code '\t'}, {@code '\u005Cu0009'}), and form feed
		''' ({@code '\f'}, {@code '\u005Cu000C'}) to be white
		''' space.
		''' 
		''' <p>
		''' If a logical line is spread across several natural lines, the
		''' backslash escaping the line terminator sequence, the line
		''' terminator sequence, and any white space at the start of the
		''' following line have no affect on the key or element values.
		''' The remainder of the discussion of key and element parsing
		''' (when loading) will assume all the characters constituting
		''' the key and element appear on a single natural line after
		''' line continuation characters have been removed.  Note that
		''' it is <i>not</i> sufficient to only examine the character
		''' preceding a line terminator sequence to decide if the line
		''' terminator is escaped; there must be an odd number of
		''' contiguous backslashes for the line terminator to be escaped.
		''' Since the input is processed from left to right, a
		''' non-zero even number of 2<i>n</i> contiguous backslashes
		''' before a line terminator (or elsewhere) encodes <i>n</i>
		''' backslashes after escape processing.
		''' 
		''' <p>
		''' The key contains all of the characters in the line starting
		''' with the first non-white space character and up to, but not
		''' including, the first unescaped {@code '='},
		''' {@code ':'}, or white space character other than a line
		''' terminator. All of these key termination characters may be
		''' included in the key by escaping them with a preceding backslash
		''' character; for example,<p>
		''' 
		''' {@code \:\=}<p>
		''' 
		''' would be the two-character key {@code ":="}.  Line
		''' terminator characters can be included using {@code \r} and
		''' {@code \n} escape sequences.  Any white space after the
		''' key is skipped; if the first non-white space character after
		''' the key is {@code '='} or {@code ':'}, then it is
		''' ignored and any white space characters after it are also
		''' skipped.  All remaining characters on the line become part of
		''' the associated element string; if there are no remaining
		''' characters, the element is the empty string
		''' {@code ""}.  Once the raw character sequences
		''' constituting the key and element are identified, escape
		''' processing is performed as described above.
		''' 
		''' <p>
		''' As an example, each of the following three lines specifies the key
		''' {@code "Truth"} and the associated element value
		''' {@code "Beauty"}:
		''' <pre>
		''' Truth = Beauty
		'''  Truth:Beauty
		''' Truth                    :Beauty
		''' </pre>
		''' As another example, the following three lines specify a single
		''' property:
		''' <pre>
		''' fruits                           apple, banana, pear, \
		'''                                  cantaloupe, watermelon, \
		'''                                  kiwi, mango
		''' </pre>
		''' The key is {@code "fruits"} and the associated element is:
		''' <pre>"apple, banana, pear, cantaloupe, watermelon, kiwi, mango"</pre>
		''' Note that a space appears before each {@code \} so that a space
		''' will appear after each comma in the final result; the {@code \},
		''' line terminator, and leading white space on the continuation line are
		''' merely discarded and are <i>not</i> replaced by one or more other
		''' characters.
		''' <p>
		''' As a third example, the line:
		''' <pre>cheeses
		''' </pre>
		''' specifies that the key is {@code "cheeses"} and the associated
		''' element is the empty string {@code ""}.
		''' <p>
		''' <a name="unicodeescapes"></a>
		''' Characters in keys and elements can be represented in escape
		''' sequences similar to those used for character and string literals
		''' (see sections 3.3 and 3.10.6 of
		''' <cite>The Java&trade; Language Specification</cite>).
		''' 
		''' The differences from the character escape sequences and Unicode
		''' escapes used for characters and strings are:
		''' 
		''' <ul>
		''' <li> Octal escapes are not recognized.
		''' 
		''' <li> The character sequence {@code \b} does <i>not</i>
		''' represent a backspace character.
		''' 
		''' <li> The method does not treat a backslash character,
		''' {@code \}, before a non-valid escape character as an
		''' error; the backslash is silently dropped.  For example, in a
		''' Java string the sequence {@code "\z"} would cause a
		''' compile time error.  In contrast, this method silently drops
		''' the backslash.  Therefore, this method treats the two character
		''' sequence {@code "\b"} as equivalent to the single
		''' character {@code 'b'}.
		''' 
		''' <li> Escapes are not necessary for single and double quotes;
		''' however, by the rule above, single and double quote characters
		''' preceded by a backslash still yield single and double quote
		''' characters, respectively.
		''' 
		''' <li> Only a single 'u' character is allowed in a Unicode escape
		''' sequence.
		''' 
		''' </ul>
		''' <p>
		''' The specified stream remains open after this method returns.
