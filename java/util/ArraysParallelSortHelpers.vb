	''' <summary>
	''' Helper utilities for the parallel sort methods in Arrays.parallelSort.
	''' 
	''' For each primitive type, plus Object, we define a static class to
	''' contain the Sorter and Merger implementations for that type:
	''' 
	''' Sorter classes based mainly on CilkSort
	''' <A href="http://supertech.lcs.mit.edu/cilk/"> Cilk</A>:
	''' Basic algorithm:
	''' if array size is small, just use a sequential quicksort (via Arrays.sort)
	'''         Otherwise:
	'''         1. Break array in half.
	'''         2. For each half,
	'''             a. break the half in half (i.e., quarters),
	'''             b. sort the quarters
	'''             c. merge them together
	'''         3. merge together the two halves.
	''' 
	''' One reason for splitting in quarters is that this guarantees that
	''' the final sort is in the main array, not the workspace array.
	''' (workspace and main swap roles on each subsort step.)  Leaf-level
	''' sorts use the associated sequential sort.
	''' 
	''' Merger classes perform merging for Sorter.  They are structured
	''' such that if the underlying sort is stable (as is true for
	''' TimSort), then so is the full sort.  If big enough, they split the
	''' largest of the two partitions in half, find the greatest point in
	''' smaller partition less than the beginning of the second half of
	''' larger via binary search; and then merge in parallel the two
	''' partitions.  In part to ensure tasks are triggered in
	''' stability-preserving order, the current CountedCompleter design
	''' requires some little tasks to serve as place holders for triggering
	''' completion tasks.  These classes (EmptyCompleter and Relay) don't
	''' need to keep track of the arrays, and are never themselves forked,
	''' so don't hold any task state.
	''' 
	''' The primitive class versions (FJByte... FJDouble) are
	''' identical to each other except for type declarations.
	''' 
	''' The base sequential sorts rely on non-public versions of TimSort,
	''' ComparableTimSort, and DualPivotQuicksort sort methods that accept
	''' temp workspace array slices that we will have already allocated, so
	''' avoids redundant allocation. (Except for DualPivotQuicksort byte[]
	''' sort, that does not ever use a workspace array.)
