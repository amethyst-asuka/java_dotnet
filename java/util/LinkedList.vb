	''' <summary>
	''' Doubly-linked list implementation of the {@code List} and {@code Deque}
	''' interfaces.  Implements all optional list operations, and permits all
	''' elements (including {@code null}).
	''' 
	''' <p>All of the operations perform as could be expected for a doubly-linked
	''' list.  Operations that index into the list will traverse the list from
	''' the beginning or the end, whichever is closer to the specified index.
	''' 
	''' <p><strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
	''' If multiple threads access a linked list concurrently, and at least
	''' one of the threads modifies the list structurally, it <i>must</i> be
	''' synchronized externally.  (A structural modification is any operation
	''' that adds or deletes one or more elements; merely setting the value of
	''' an element is not a structural modification.)  This is typically
	''' accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally
	''' encapsulates the list.
	''' 
	''' If no such object exists, the list should be "wrapped" using the
	''' <seealso cref="Collections#synchronizedList Collections.synchronizedList"/>
	''' method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
	''' unsynchronized access to the list:<pre>
	'''   List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new LinkedList(...));</pre>
	''' 
	''' <p>The iterators returned by this class's {@code iterator} and
	''' {@code listIterator} methods are <i>fail-fast</i>: if the list is
	''' structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in
	''' any way except through the Iterator's own {@code remove} or
	''' {@code add} methods, the iterator will throw a {@link
	''' ConcurrentModificationException}.  Thus, in the face of concurrent
	''' modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than
	''' risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined
	''' time in the future.
	''' 
	''' <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
	''' as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
	''' presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
	''' throw {@code ConcurrentModificationException} on a best-effort basis.
	''' Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
	''' exception for its correctness:   <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
	''' should be used only to detect bugs.</i>
	''' 
	''' <p>This class is a member of the
