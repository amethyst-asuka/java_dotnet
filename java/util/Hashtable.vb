	''' <summary>
	''' This class implements a hash table, which maps keys to values. Any
	''' non-<code>null</code> object can be used as a key or as a value. <p>
	''' 
	''' To successfully store and retrieve objects from a hashtable, the
	''' objects used as keys must implement the <code>hashCode</code>
	''' method and the <code>equals</code> method. <p>
	''' 
	''' An instance of <code>Hashtable</code> has two parameters that affect its
	''' performance: <i>initial capacity</i> and <i>load factor</i>.  The
	''' <i>capacity</i> is the number of <i>buckets</i> in the hash table, and the
	''' <i>initial capacity</i> is simply the capacity at the time the hash table
	''' is created.  Note that the hash table is <i>open</i>: in the case of a "hash
	''' collision", a single bucket stores multiple entries, which must be searched
	''' sequentially.  The <i>load factor</i> is a measure of how full the hash
	''' table is allowed to get before its capacity is automatically increased.
	''' The initial capacity and load factor parameters are merely hints to
	''' the implementation.  The exact details as to when and whether the rehash
	''' method is invoked are implementation-dependent.<p>
	''' 
	''' Generally, the default load factor (.75) offers a good tradeoff between
	''' time and space costs.  Higher values decrease the space overhead but
	''' increase the time cost to look up an entry (which is reflected in most
	''' <tt>Hashtable</tt> operations, including <tt>get</tt> and <tt>put</tt>).<p>
	''' 
	''' The initial capacity controls a tradeoff between wasted space and the
	''' need for <code>rehash</code> operations, which are time-consuming.
	''' No <code>rehash</code> operations will <i>ever</i> occur if the initial
	''' capacity is greater than the maximum number of entries the
	''' <tt>Hashtable</tt> will contain divided by its load factor.  However,
	''' setting the initial capacity too high can waste space.<p>
	''' 
	''' If many entries are to be made into a <code>Hashtable</code>,
	''' creating it with a sufficiently large capacity may allow the
	''' entries to be inserted more efficiently than letting it perform
	''' automatic rehashing as needed to grow the table. <p>
	''' 
	''' This example creates a hashtable of numbers. It uses the names of
	''' the numbers as keys:
	''' <pre>   {@code
	'''   Hashtable<String, Integer> numbers
	'''     = new Hashtable<String, Integer>();
	'''   numbers.put("one", 1);
	'''   numbers.put("two", 2);
	'''   numbers.put("three", 3);}</pre>
	''' 
	''' <p>To retrieve a number, use the following code:
	''' <pre>   {@code
	'''   Integer n = numbers.get("two");
	'''   if (n != null) {
	'''     System.out.println("two = " + n);
	'''   }}</pre>
	''' 
	''' <p>The iterators returned by the <tt>iterator</tt> method of the collections
	''' returned by all of this class's "collection view methods" are
	''' <em>fail-fast</em>: if the Hashtable is structurally modified at any time
	''' after the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own
	''' <tt>remove</tt> method, the iterator will throw a {@link
	''' ConcurrentModificationException}.  Thus, in the face of concurrent
	''' modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking
	''' arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future.
	''' The Enumerations returned by Hashtable's keys and elements methods are
	''' <em>not</em> fail-fast.
	''' 
	''' <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
	''' as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
	''' presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
	''' throw <tt>ConcurrentModificationException</tt> on a best-effort basis.
	''' Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
	''' exception for its correctness: <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
	''' should be used only to detect bugs.</i>
	''' 
	''' <p>As of the Java 2 platform v1.2, this class was retrofitted to
	''' implement the <seealso cref="Map"/> interface, making it a member of the
	''' <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
	''' 
	''' Java Collections Framework</a>.  Unlike the new collection
	''' implementations, {@code Hashtable} is synchronized.  If a
	''' thread-safe implementation is not needed, it is recommended to use
	''' <seealso cref="HashMap"/> in place of {@code Hashtable}.  If a thread-safe
	''' highly-concurrent implementation is desired, then it is recommended
	''' to use <seealso cref="java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap"/> in place of
	''' {@code Hashtable}.
