	''' <summary>
	''' Resizable-array implementation of the <seealso cref="Deque"/> interface.  Array
	''' deques have no capacity restrictions; they grow as necessary to support
	''' usage.  They are not thread-safe; in the absence of external
	''' synchronization, they do not support concurrent access by multiple threads.
	''' Null elements are prohibited.  This class is likely to be faster than
	''' <seealso cref="Stack"/> when used as a stack, and faster than <seealso cref="LinkedList"/>
	''' when used as a queue.
	''' 
	''' <p>Most {@code ArrayDeque} operations run in amortized constant time.
	''' Exceptions include <seealso cref="#remove(Object) remove"/>, {@link
	''' #removeFirstOccurrence removeFirstOccurrence}, {@link #removeLastOccurrence
	''' removeLastOccurrence}, <seealso cref="#contains contains"/>, {@link #iterator
	''' iterator.remove()}, and the bulk operations, all of which run in linear
	''' time.
	''' 
	''' <p>The iterators returned by this class's {@code iterator} method are
	''' <i>fail-fast</i>: If the deque is modified at any time after the iterator
	''' is created, in any way except through the iterator's own {@code remove}
	''' method, the iterator will generally throw a {@link
	''' ConcurrentModificationException}.  Thus, in the face of concurrent
	''' modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking
	''' arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the
	''' future.
	''' 
	''' <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
	''' as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
	''' presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
	''' throw {@code ConcurrentModificationException} on a best-effort basis.
	''' Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
	''' exception for its correctness: <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
	''' should be used only to detect bugs.</i>
	''' 
	''' <p>This class and its iterator implement all of the
	''' <em>optional</em> methods of the <seealso cref="Collection"/> and {@link
	''' Iterator} interfaces.
	''' 
	''' <p>This class is a member of the
