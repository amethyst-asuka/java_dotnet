	''' <summary>
	''' A <seealso cref="java.util.Set"/> that uses an internal <seealso cref="CopyOnWriteArrayList"/>
	''' for all of its operations.  Thus, it shares the same basic properties:
	''' <ul>
	'''  <li>It is best suited for applications in which set sizes generally
	'''       stay small, read-only operations
	'''       vastly outnumber mutative operations, and you need
	'''       to prevent interference among threads during traversal.
	'''  <li>It is thread-safe.
	'''  <li>Mutative operations ({@code add}, {@code set}, {@code remove}, etc.)
	'''      are expensive since they usually entail copying the entire underlying
	'''      array.
	'''  <li>Iterators do not support the mutative {@code remove} operation.
	'''  <li>Traversal via iterators is fast and cannot encounter
	'''      interference from other threads. Iterators rely on
	'''      unchanging snapshots of the array at the time the iterators were
	'''      constructed.
	''' </ul>
	''' 
	''' <p><b>Sample Usage.</b> The following code sketch uses a
	''' copy-on-write set to maintain a set of Handler objects that
	''' perform some action upon state updates.
	''' 
	'''  <pre> {@code
	''' class Handler { void handle(); ... }
	''' 
	''' class X {
	'''   private final CopyOnWriteArraySet<Handler> handlers
	'''     = new CopyOnWriteArraySet<Handler>();
	'''   public void addHandler(Handler h) { handlers.add(h); }
	''' 
	'''   private long internalState;
	'''   private synchronized void changeState() { internalState = ...; }
	''' 
	'''   public void update() {
	'''     changeState();
	'''     for (Handler handler : handlers)
	'''       handler.handle();
	'''   }
	''' }}</pre>
