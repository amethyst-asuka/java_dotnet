	''' <summary>
	''' Provides default implementations of <seealso cref="ExecutorService"/>
	''' execution methods. This class implements the {@code submit},
	''' {@code invokeAny} and {@code invokeAll} methods using a
	''' <seealso cref="RunnableFuture"/> returned by {@code newTaskFor}, which defaults
	''' to the <seealso cref="FutureTask"/> class provided in this package.  For example,
	''' the implementation of {@code submit(Runnable)} creates an
	''' associated {@code RunnableFuture} that is executed and
	''' returned. Subclasses may override the {@code newTaskFor} methods
	''' to return {@code RunnableFuture} implementations other than
	''' {@code FutureTask}.
	''' 
	''' <p><b>Extension example</b>. Here is a sketch of a class
	''' that customizes <seealso cref="ThreadPoolExecutor"/> to use
	''' a {@code CustomTask} class instead of the default {@code FutureTask}:
	'''  <pre> {@code
	''' public class CustomThreadPoolExecutor extends ThreadPoolExecutor {
	''' 
	'''   static class CustomTask<V> implements RunnableFuture<V> {...}
	''' 
	'''   protected <V> RunnableFuture<V> newTaskFor(Callable<V> c) {
	'''       return new CustomTask<V>(c);
	'''   }
	'''   protected <V> RunnableFuture<V> newTaskFor(Runnable r, V v) {
	'''       return new CustomTask<V>(r, v);
	'''   }
	'''   // ... add constructors, etc.
