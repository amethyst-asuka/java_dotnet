	Public Class ConcurrentSkipListMap(Of K, V)
		Inherits java.util.AbstractMap(Of K, V)
		Implements java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentNavigableMap(Of K, V), Cloneable

	'    
	'     * This class implements a tree-like two-dimensionally linked skip
	'     * list in which the index levels are represented in separate
	'     * nodes from the base nodes holding data.  There are two reasons
	'     * for taking this approach instead of the usual array-based
	'     * structure: 1) Array based implementations seem to encounter
	'     * more complexity and overhead 2) We can use cheaper algorithms
	'     * for the heavily-traversed index lists than can be used for the
	'     * base lists.  Here's a picture of some of the basics for a
	'     * possible list with 2 levels of index:
	'     *
	'     * Head nodes          Index nodes
	'     * +-+    right        +-+                      +-+
	'     * |2|---------------->| |--------------------->| |->null
	'     * +-+                 +-+                      +-+
	'     *  | down              |                        |
	'     *  v                   v                        v
	'     * +-+            +-+  +-+       +-+            +-+       +-+
	'     * |1|----------->| |->| |------>| |----------->| |------>| |->null
	'     * +-+            +-+  +-+       +-+            +-+       +-+
	'     *  v              |    |         |              |         |
	'     * Nodes  next     v    v         v              v         v

	'     * The base lists use a variant of the HM linked ordered set
	'     * algorithm. See Tim Harris, "A pragmatic implementation of
	'     * non-blocking linked lists"
	'     * http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~tlh20/publications.html and Maged
	'     * Michael "High Performance Dynamic Lock-Free Hash Tables and
	'     * List-Based Sets"
	'     * http://www.research.ibm.com/people/m/michael/pubs.htm.  The
	'     * basic idea in these lists is to mark the "next" pointers of
	'     * deleted nodes when deleting to avoid conflicts with concurrent
	'     * insertions, and when traversing to keep track of triples
	'     * (predecessor, node, successor) in order to detect when and how
	'     * to unlink these deleted nodes.
	'     *
	'     * Rather than using mark-bits to mark list deletions (which can
	'     * be slow and space-intensive using AtomicMarkedReference), nodes
	'     * use direct CAS'able next pointers.  On deletion, instead of
	'     * marking a pointer, they splice in another node that can be
	'     * thought of as standing for a marked pointer (indicating this by
	'     * using otherwise impossible field values).  Using plain nodes
	'     * acts roughly like "boxed" implementations of marked pointers,
	'     * but uses new nodes only when nodes are deleted, not for every
	'     * link.  This requires less space and supports faster
	'     * traversal. Even if marked references were better supported by
	'     * JVMs, traversal using this technique might still be faster
	'     * because any search need only read ahead one more node than
	'     * otherwise required (to check for trailing marker) rather than
	'     * unmasking mark bits or whatever on each read.
	'     *
	'     * This approach maintains the essential property needed in the HM
	'     * algorithm of changing the next-pointer of a deleted node so
	'     * that any other CAS of it will fail, but implements the idea by
	'     * changing the pointer to point to a different node, not by
	'     * marking it.  While it would be possible to further squeeze
	'     * space by defining marker nodes not to have key/value fields, it
	'     * isn't worth the extra type-testing overhead.  The deletion
	'     * markers are rarely encountered during traversal and are
	'     * normally quickly garbage collected. (Note that this technique
	'     * would not work well in systems without garbage collection.)
	'     *
	'     * In addition to using deletion markers, the lists also use
	'     * nullness of value fields to indicate deletion, in a style
	'     * similar to typical lazy-deletion schemes.  If a node's value is
	'     * null, then it is considered logically deleted and ignored even
	'     * though it is still reachable. This maintains proper control of
	'     * concurrent replace vs delete operations -- an attempted replace
	'     * must fail if a delete beat it by nulling field, and a delete
	'     * must return the last non-null value held in the field. (Note:
	'     * Null, rather than some special marker, is used for value fields
	'     * here because it just so happens to mesh with the Map API
	'     * requirement that method get returns null if there is no
	'     * mapping, which allows nodes to remain concurrently readable
	'     * even when deleted. Using any other marker value here would be
	'     * messy at best.)
	'     *
	'     * Here's the sequence of events for a deletion of node n with
	'     * predecessor b and successor f, initially:
	'     *
	'     *        +------+       +------+      +------+
	'     *   ...  |   b  |------>|   n  |----->|   f  | ...
	'     *        +------+       +------+      +------+
	'     *
	'     * 1. CAS n's value field from non-null to null.
	'     *    From this point on, no public operations encountering
	'     *    the node consider this mapping to exist. However, other
	'     *    ongoing insertions and deletions might still modify
	'     *    n's next pointer.
	'     *
	'     * 2. CAS n's next pointer to point to a new marker node.
	'     *    From this point on, no other nodes can be appended to n.
	'     *    which avoids deletion errors in CAS-based linked lists.
	'     *
	'     *        +------+       +------+      +------+       +------+
	'     *   ...  |   b  |------>|   n  |----->|marker|------>|   f  | ...
	'     *        +------+       +------+      +------+       +------+
	'     *
	'     * 3. CAS b's next pointer over both n and its marker.
	'     *    From this point on, no new traversals will encounter n,
	'     *    and it can eventually be GCed.
	'     *        +------+                                    +------+
	'     *   ...  |   b  |----------------------------------->|   f  | ...
	'     *        +------+                                    +------+
	'     *
	'     * A failure at step 1 leads to simple retry due to a lost race
	'     * with another operation. Steps 2-3 can fail because some other
	'     * thread noticed during a traversal a node with null value and
	'     * helped out by marking and/or unlinking.  This helping-out
	'     * ensures that no thread can become stuck waiting for progress of
	'     * the deleting thread.  The use of marker nodes slightly
	'     * complicates helping-out code because traversals must track
	'     * consistent reads of up to four nodes (b, n, marker, f), not
	'     * just (b, n, f), although the next field of a marker is
	'     * immutable, and once a next field is CAS'ed to point to a
	'     * marker, it never again changes, so this requires less care.
	'     *
	'     * Skip lists add indexing to this scheme, so that the base-level
	'     * traversals start close to the locations being found, inserted
	'     * or deleted -- usually base level traversals only traverse a few
	'     * nodes. This doesn't change the basic algorithm except for the
	'     * need to make sure base traversals start at predecessors (here,
	'     * b) that are not (structurally) deleted, otherwise retrying
	'     * after processing the deletion.
	'     *
	'     * Index levels are maintained as lists with volatile next fields,
	'     * using CAS to link and unlink.  Races are allowed in index-list
	'     * operations that can (rarely) fail to link in a new index node
	'     * or delete one. (We can't do this of course for data nodes.)
	'     * However, even when this happens, the index lists remain sorted,
	'     * so correctly serve as indices.  This can impact performance,
	'     * but since skip lists are probabilistic anyway, the net result
	'     * is that under contention, the effective "p" value may be lower
	'     * than its nominal value. And race windows are kept small enough
	'     * that in practice these failures are rare, even under a lot of
	'     * contention.
	'     *
	'     * The fact that retries (for both base and index lists) are
	'     * relatively cheap due to indexing allows some minor
	'     * simplifications of retry logic. Traversal restarts are
	'     * performed after most "helping-out" CASes. This isn't always
	'     * strictly necessary, but the implicit backoffs tend to help
	'     * reduce other downstream failed CAS's enough to outweigh restart
	'     * cost.  This worsens the worst case, but seems to improve even
	'     * highly contended cases.
	'     *
	'     * Unlike most skip-list implementations, index insertion and
	'     * deletion here require a separate traversal pass occurring after
	'     * the base-level action, to add or remove index nodes.  This adds
	'     * to single-threaded overhead, but improves contended
	'     * multithreaded performance by narrowing interference windows,
	'     * and allows deletion to ensure that all index nodes will be made
	'     * unreachable upon return from a public remove operation, thus
	'     * avoiding unwanted garbage retention. This is more important
	'     * here than in some other data structures because we cannot null
	'     * out node fields referencing user keys since they might still be
	'     * read by other ongoing traversals.
	'     *
	'     * Indexing uses skip list parameters that maintain good search
	'     * performance while using sparser-than-usual indices: The
	'     * hardwired parameters k=1, p=0.5 (see method doPut) mean
	'     * that about one-quarter of the nodes have indices. Of those that
	'     * do, half have one level, a quarter have two, and so on (see
	'     * Pugh's Skip List Cookbook, sec 3.4).  The expected total space
	'     * requirement for a map is slightly less than for the current
	'     * implementation of java.util.TreeMap.
	'     *
	'     * Changing the level of the index (i.e, the height of the
	'     * tree-like structure) also uses CAS. The head index has initial
	'     * level/height of one. Creation of an index with height greater
	'     * than the current level adds a level to the head index by
	'     * CAS'ing on a new top-most head. To maintain good performance
	'     * after a lot of removals, deletion methods heuristically try to
	'     * reduce the height if the topmost levels appear to be empty.
	'     * This may encounter races in which it possible (but rare) to
	'     * reduce and "lose" a level just as it is about to contain an
	'     * index (that will then never be encountered). This does no
	'     * structural harm, and in practice appears to be a better option
	'     * than allowing unrestrained growth of levels.
	'     *
	'     * The code for all this is more verbose than you'd like. Most
	'     * operations entail locating an element (or position to insert an
	'     * element). The code to do this can't be nicely factored out
	'     * because subsequent uses require a snapshot of predecessor
	'     * and/or successor and/or value fields which can't be returned
	'     * all at once, at least not without creating yet another object
	'     * to hold them -- creating such little objects is an especially
	'     * bad idea for basic internal search operations because it adds
	'     * to GC overhead.  (This is one of the few times I've wished Java
	'     * had macros.) Instead, some traversal code is interleaved within
	'     * insertion and removal operations.  The control logic to handle
	'     * all the retry conditions is sometimes twisty. Most search is
	'     * broken into 2 parts. findPredecessor() searches index nodes
	'     * only, returning a base-level predecessor of the key. findNode()
	'     * finishes out the base-level search. Even with this factoring,
	'     * there is a fair amount of near-duplication of code to handle
	'     * variants.
	'     *
	'     * To produce random values without interference across threads,
	'     * we use within-JDK thread local random support (via the
	'     * "secondary seed", to avoid interference with user-level
	'     * ThreadLocalRandom.)
	'     *
	'     * A previous version of this class wrapped non-comparable keys
	'     * with their comparators to emulate Comparables when using
	'     * comparators vs Comparables.  However, JVMs now appear to better
	'     * handle infusing comparator-vs-comparable choice into search
	'     * loops. Static method cpr(comparator, x, y) is used for all
	'     * comparisons, which works well as long as the comparator
	'     * argument is set up outside of loops (thus sometimes passed as
	'     * an argument to internal methods) to avoid field re-reads.
	'     *
	'     * For explanation of algorithms sharing at least a couple of
	'     * features with this one, see Mikhail Fomitchev's thesis
	'     * (http://www.cs.yorku.ca/~mikhail/), Keir Fraser's thesis
	'     * (http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/kaf24/), and Hakan Sundell's
	'     * thesis (http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~phs/).
	'     *
	'     * Given the use of tree-like index nodes, you might wonder why
	'     * this doesn't use some kind of search tree instead, which would
	'     * support somewhat faster search operations. The reason is that
	'     * there are no known efficient lock-free insertion and deletion
	'     * algorithms for search trees. The immutability of the "down"
	'     * links of index nodes (as opposed to mutable "left" fields in
	'     * true trees) makes this tractable using only CAS operations.
