	''' <summary>
	''' An <seealso cref="ExecutorService"/> that executes each submitted task using
	''' one of possibly several pooled threads, normally configured
	''' using <seealso cref="Executors"/> factory methods.
	''' 
	''' <p>Thread pools address two different problems: they usually
	''' provide improved performance when executing large numbers of
	''' asynchronous tasks, due to reduced per-task invocation overhead,
	''' and they provide a means of bounding and managing the resources,
	''' including threads, consumed when executing a collection of tasks.
	''' Each {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} also maintains some basic
	''' statistics, such as the number of completed tasks.
	''' 
	''' <p>To be useful across a wide range of contexts, this class
	''' provides many adjustable parameters and extensibility
	''' hooks. However, programmers are urged to use the more convenient
	''' <seealso cref="Executors"/> factory methods {@link
	''' Executors#newCachedThreadPool} (unbounded thread pool, with
	''' automatic thread reclamation), <seealso cref="Executors#newFixedThreadPool"/>
	''' (fixed size thread pool) and {@link
	''' Executors#newSingleThreadExecutor} (single background thread), that
	''' preconfigure settings for the most common usage
	''' scenarios. Otherwise, use the following guide when manually
	''' configuring and tuning this class:
	''' 
	''' <dl>
	''' 
	''' <dt>Core and maximum pool sizes</dt>
	''' 
	''' <dd>A {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} will automatically adjust the
	''' pool size (see <seealso cref="#getPoolSize"/>)
	''' according to the bounds set by
	''' corePoolSize (see <seealso cref="#getCorePoolSize"/>) and
	''' maximumPoolSize (see <seealso cref="#getMaximumPoolSize"/>).
	''' 
	''' When a new task is submitted in method <seealso cref="#execute(Runnable)"/>,
	''' and fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, a new thread is
	''' created to handle the request, even if other worker threads are
	''' idle.  If there are more than corePoolSize but less than
	''' maximumPoolSize threads running, a new thread will be created only
	''' if the queue is full.  By setting corePoolSize and maximumPoolSize
	''' the same, you create a fixed-size thread pool. By setting
	''' maximumPoolSize to an essentially unbounded value such as {@code
	''' Integer.MAX_VALUE}, you allow the pool to accommodate an arbitrary
	''' number of concurrent tasks. Most typically, core and maximum pool
	''' sizes are set only upon construction, but they may also be changed
	''' dynamically using <seealso cref="#setCorePoolSize"/> and {@link
	''' #setMaximumPoolSize}. </dd>
	''' 
	''' <dt>On-demand construction</dt>
	''' 
	''' <dd>By default, even core threads are initially created and
	''' started only when new tasks arrive, but this can be overridden
	''' dynamically using method <seealso cref="#prestartCoreThread"/> or {@link
	''' #prestartAllCoreThreads}.  You probably want to prestart threads if
	''' you construct the pool with a non-empty queue. </dd>
	''' 
	''' <dt>Creating new threads</dt>
	''' 
	''' <dd>New threads are created using a <seealso cref="ThreadFactory"/>.  If not
	''' otherwise specified, a <seealso cref="Executors#defaultThreadFactory"/> is
	''' used, that creates threads to all be in the same {@link
	''' ThreadGroup} and with the same {@code NORM_PRIORITY} priority and
	''' non-daemon status. By supplying a different ThreadFactory, you can
	''' alter the thread's name, thread group, priority, daemon status,
	''' etc. If a {@code ThreadFactory} fails to create a thread when asked
	''' by returning null from {@code newThread}, the executor will
	''' continue, but might not be able to execute any tasks. Threads
	''' should possess the "modifyThread" {@code RuntimePermission}. If
	''' worker threads or other threads using the pool do not possess this
	''' permission, service may be degraded: configuration changes may not
	''' take effect in a timely manner, and a shutdown pool may remain in a
	''' state in which termination is possible but not completed.</dd>
	''' 
	''' <dt>Keep-alive times</dt>
	''' 
	''' <dd>If the pool currently has more than corePoolSize threads,
	''' excess threads will be terminated if they have been idle for more
	''' than the keepAliveTime (see <seealso cref="#getKeepAliveTime(TimeUnit)"/>).
	''' This provides a means of reducing resource consumption when the
	''' pool is not being actively used. If the pool becomes more active
	''' later, new threads will be constructed. This parameter can also be
	''' changed dynamically using method {@link #setKeepAliveTime(long,
	''' TimeUnit)}.  Using a value of {@code Long.MAX_VALUE} {@link
	''' TimeUnit#NANOSECONDS} effectively disables idle threads from ever
	''' terminating prior to shut down. By default, the keep-alive policy
	''' applies only when there are more than corePoolSize threads. But
	''' method <seealso cref="#allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)"/> can be used to
	''' apply this time-out policy to core threads as well, so long as the
	''' keepAliveTime value is non-zero. </dd>
	''' 
	''' <dt>Queuing</dt>
	''' 
	''' <dd>Any <seealso cref="BlockingQueue"/> may be used to transfer and hold
	''' submitted tasks.  The use of this queue interacts with pool sizing:
	''' 
	''' <ul>
	''' 
	''' <li> If fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, the Executor
	''' always prefers adding a new thread
	''' rather than queuing.</li>
	''' 
	''' <li> If corePoolSize or more threads are running, the Executor
	''' always prefers queuing a request rather than adding a new
	''' thread.</li>
	''' 
	''' <li> If a request cannot be queued, a new thread is created unless
	''' this would exceed maximumPoolSize, in which case, the task will be
	''' rejected.</li>
	''' 
	''' </ul>
	''' 
	''' There are three general strategies for queuing:
	''' <ol>
	''' 
	''' <li> <em> Direct handoffs.</em> A good default choice for a work
	''' queue is a <seealso cref="SynchronousQueue"/> that hands off tasks to threads
	''' without otherwise holding them. Here, an attempt to queue a task
	''' will fail if no threads are immediately available to run it, so a
	''' new thread will be constructed. This policy avoids lockups when
	''' handling sets of requests that might have internal dependencies.
	''' Direct handoffs generally require unbounded maximumPoolSizes to
	''' avoid rejection of new submitted tasks. This in turn admits the
	''' possibility of unbounded thread growth when commands continue to
	''' arrive on average faster than they can be processed.  </li>
	''' 
	''' <li><em> Unbounded queues.</em> Using an unbounded queue (for
	''' example a <seealso cref="LinkedBlockingQueue"/> without a predefined
	''' capacity) will cause new tasks to wait in the queue when all
	''' corePoolSize threads are busy. Thus, no more than corePoolSize
	''' threads will ever be created. (And the value of the maximumPoolSize
	''' therefore doesn't have any effect.)  This may be appropriate when
	''' each task is completely independent of others, so tasks cannot
	''' affect each others execution; for example, in a web page server.
	''' While this style of queuing can be useful in smoothing out
	''' transient bursts of requests, it admits the possibility of
	''' unbounded work queue growth when commands continue to arrive on
	''' average faster than they can be processed.  </li>
	''' 
	''' <li><em>Bounded queues.</em> A bounded queue (for example, an
	''' <seealso cref="ArrayBlockingQueue"/>) helps prevent resource exhaustion when
	''' used with finite maximumPoolSizes, but can be more difficult to
	''' tune and control.  Queue sizes and maximum pool sizes may be traded
	''' off for each other: Using large queues and small pools minimizes
	''' CPU usage, OS resources, and context-switching overhead, but can
	''' lead to artificially low throughput.  If tasks frequently block (for
	''' example if they are I/O bound), a system may be able to schedule
	''' time for more threads than you otherwise allow. Use of small queues
	''' generally requires larger pool sizes, which keeps CPUs busier but
	''' may encounter unacceptable scheduling overhead, which also
	''' decreases throughput.  </li>
	''' 
	''' </ol>
	''' 
	''' </dd>
	''' 
	''' <dt>Rejected tasks</dt>
	''' 
	''' <dd>New tasks submitted in method <seealso cref="#execute(Runnable)"/> will be
	''' <em>rejected</em> when the Executor has been shut down, and also when
	''' the Executor uses finite bounds for both maximum threads and work queue
	''' capacity, and is saturated.  In either case, the {@code execute} method
	''' invokes the {@link
	''' RejectedExecutionHandler#rejectedExecution(Runnable, ThreadPoolExecutor)}
	''' method of its <seealso cref="RejectedExecutionHandler"/>.  Four predefined handler
	''' policies are provided:
	''' 
	''' <ol>
	''' 
	''' <li> In the default <seealso cref="ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy"/>, the
	''' handler throws a runtime <seealso cref="RejectedExecutionException"/> upon
	''' rejection. </li>
	''' 
	''' <li> In <seealso cref="ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy"/>, the thread
	''' that invokes {@code execute} itself runs the task. This provides a
	''' simple feedback control mechanism that will slow down the rate that
	''' new tasks are submitted. </li>
	''' 
	''' <li> In <seealso cref="ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy"/>, a task that
	''' cannot be executed is simply dropped.  </li>
	''' 
	''' <li>In <seealso cref="ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy"/>, if the
	''' executor is not shut down, the task at the head of the work queue
	''' is dropped, and then execution is retried (which can fail again,
	''' causing this to be repeated.) </li>
	''' 
	''' </ol>
	''' 
	''' It is possible to define and use other kinds of {@link
	''' RejectedExecutionHandler} classes. Doing so requires some care
	''' especially when policies are designed to work only under particular
	''' capacity or queuing policies. </dd>
	''' 
	''' <dt>Hook methods</dt>
	''' 
	''' <dd>This class provides {@code protected} overridable
	''' <seealso cref="#beforeExecute(Thread, Runnable)"/> and
	''' <seealso cref="#afterExecute(Runnable, Throwable)"/> methods that are called
	''' before and after execution of each task.  These can be used to
	''' manipulate the execution environment; for example, reinitializing
	''' ThreadLocals, gathering statistics, or adding log entries.
	''' Additionally, method <seealso cref="#terminated"/> can be overridden to perform
	''' any special processing that needs to be done once the Executor has
	''' fully terminated.
	''' 
	''' <p>If hook or callback methods throw exceptions, internal worker
	''' threads may in turn fail and abruptly terminate.</dd>
	''' 
	''' <dt>Queue maintenance</dt>
	''' 
	''' <dd>Method <seealso cref="#getQueue()"/> allows access to the work queue
	''' for purposes of monitoring and debugging.  Use of this method for
	''' any other purpose is strongly discouraged.  Two supplied methods,
	''' <seealso cref="#remove(Runnable)"/> and <seealso cref="#purge"/> are available to
	''' assist in storage reclamation when large numbers of queued tasks
	''' become cancelled.</dd>
	''' 
	''' <dt>Finalization</dt>
	''' 
	''' <dd>A pool that is no longer referenced in a program <em>AND</em>
	''' has no remaining threads will be {@code shutdown} automatically. If
	''' you would like to ensure that unreferenced pools are reclaimed even
	''' if users forget to call <seealso cref="#shutdown"/>, then you must arrange
	''' that unused threads eventually die, by setting appropriate
	''' keep-alive times, using a lower bound of zero core threads and/or
	''' setting <seealso cref="#allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)"/>.  </dd>
	''' 
	''' </dl>
	''' 
	''' <p><b>Extension example</b>. Most extensions of this class
	''' override one or more of the protected hook methods. For example,
	''' here is a subclass that adds a simple pause/resume feature:
	''' 
	'''  <pre> {@code
	''' class PausableThreadPoolExecutor extends ThreadPoolExecutor {
	'''   private boolean isPaused;
	'''   private ReentrantLock pauseLock = new ReentrantLock();
	'''   private Condition unpaused = pauseLock.newCondition();
	''' 
	'''   public PausableThreadPoolExecutor(...) { super(...); }
	''' 
	'''   protected void beforeExecute(Thread t, Runnable r) {
	'''     super.beforeExecute(t, r);
	'''     pauseLock.lock();
	'''     try {
	'''       while (isPaused) unpaused.await();
	'''     } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
	'''       t.interrupt();

	Public Class ThreadPoolExecutor

		''' <summary>
		''' The main pool control state, ctl, is an atomic integer packing
		''' two conceptual fields
		'''   workerCount, indicating the effective number of threads
		'''   runState,    indicating whether running, shutting down etc
		''' 
		''' In order to pack them into one int, we limit workerCount to
		''' (2^29)-1 (about 500 million) threads rather than (2^31)-1 (2
		''' billion) otherwise representable. If this is ever an issue in
		''' the future, the variable can be changed to be an AtomicLong,
		''' and the shift/mask constants below adjusted. But until the need
		''' arises, this code is a bit faster and simpler using an int.
		''' 
		''' The workerCount is the number of workers that have been
		''' permitted to start and not permitted to stop.  The value may be
		''' transiently different from the actual number of live threads,
		''' for example when a ThreadFactory fails to create a thread when
		''' asked, and when exiting threads are still performing
		''' bookkeeping before terminating. The user-visible pool size is
		''' reported as the current size of the workers set.
		''' 
		''' The runState provides the main lifecycle control, taking on values:
		''' 
		'''   RUNNING:  Accept new tasks and process queued tasks
		'''   SHUTDOWN: Don't accept new tasks, but process queued tasks
		'''   STOP:     Don't accept new tasks, don't process queued tasks,
		'''             and interrupt in-progress tasks
		'''   TIDYING:  All tasks have terminated, workerCount is zero,
		'''             the thread transitioning to state TIDYING
		'''             will run the terminated() hook method
		'''   TERMINATED: terminated() has completed
		''' 
		''' The numerical order among these values matters, to allow
		''' ordered comparisons. The runState monotonically increases over
		''' time, but need not hit each state. The transitions are:
		''' 
		''' RUNNING -> SHUTDOWN
		'''    On invocation of shutdown(), perhaps implicitly in finalize()
		''' (RUNNING or SHUTDOWN) -> STOP
		'''    On invocation of shutdownNow()
		''' SHUTDOWN -> TIDYING
		'''    When both queue and pool are empty
		''' STOP -> TIDYING
		'''    When pool is empty
		''' TIDYING -> TERMINATED
		'''    When the terminated() hook method has completed
		''' 
		''' Threads waiting in awaitTermination() will return when the
		''' state reaches TERMINATED.
		''' 
		''' Detecting the transition from SHUTDOWN to TIDYING is less
		''' straightforward than you'd like because the queue may become
		''' empty after non-empty and vice versa during SHUTDOWN state, but
		''' we can only terminate if, after seeing that it is empty, we see
		''' that workerCount is 0 (which sometimes entails a recheck -- see
		''' below).
