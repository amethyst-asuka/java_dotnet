	''' <summary>
	''' One or more variables that together maintain a running {@code long}
	''' value updated using a supplied function.  When updates (method
	''' <seealso cref="#accumulate"/>) are contended across threads, the set of variables
	''' may grow dynamically to reduce contention.  Method <seealso cref="#get"/>
	''' (or, equivalently, <seealso cref="#longValue"/>) returns the current value
	''' across the variables maintaining updates.
	''' 
	''' <p>This class is usually preferable to <seealso cref="AtomicLong"/> when
	''' multiple threads update a common value that is used for purposes such
	''' as collecting statistics, not for fine-grained synchronization
	''' control.  Under low update contention, the two classes have similar
	''' characteristics. But under high contention, expected throughput of
	''' this class is significantly higher, at the expense of higher space
	''' consumption.
	''' 
	''' <p>The order of accumulation within or across threads is not
	''' guaranteed and cannot be depended upon, so this class is only
	''' applicable to functions for which the order of accumulation does
	''' not matter. The supplied accumulator function should be
	''' side-effect-free, since it may be re-applied when attempted updates
	''' fail due to contention among threads. The function is applied with
	''' the current value as its first argument, and the given update as
	''' the second argument.  For example, to maintain a running maximum
	''' value, you could supply {@code Long::max} along with {@code
	''' java.lang.[Long].MIN_VALUE} as the identity.
	''' 
	''' <p>Class <seealso cref="LongAdder"/> provides analogs of the functionality of
	''' this class for the common special case of maintaining counts and
	''' sums.  The call {@code new LongAdder()} is equivalent to {@code new
	''' LongAccumulator((x, y) -> x + y, 0L}.
	''' 
	''' <p>This class extends <seealso cref="Number"/>, but does <em>not</em> define
	''' methods such as {@code equals}, {@code hashCode} and {@code
	''' compareTo} because instances are expected to be mutated, and so are
	''' not useful as collection keys.
