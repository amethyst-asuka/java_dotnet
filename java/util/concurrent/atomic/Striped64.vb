'JAVA TO VB CONVERTER TODO TASK: Most Java annotations will not have direct .NET equivalent attributes:
	Friend MustInherit Class Striped64
		Inherits Number
	'    
	'     * This class maintains a lazily-initialized table of atomically
	'     * updated variables, plus an extra "base" field. The table size
	'     * is a power of two. Indexing uses masked per-thread hash codes.
	'     * Nearly all declarations in this class are package-private,
	'     * accessed directly by subclasses.
	'     *
	'     * Table entries are of class Cell; a variant of AtomicLong padded
	'     * (via @sun.misc.Contended) to reduce cache contention. Padding
	'     * is overkill for most Atomics because they are usually
	'     * irregularly scattered in memory and thus don't interfere much
	'     * with each other. But Atomic objects residing in arrays will
	'     * tend to be placed adjacent to each other, and so will most
	'     * often share cache lines (with a huge negative performance
	'     * impact) without this precaution.
	'     *
	'     * In part because Cells are relatively large, we avoid creating
	'     * them until they are needed.  When there is no contention, all
	'     * updates are made to the base field.  Upon first contention (a
	'     * failed CAS on base update), the table is initialized to size 2.
	'     * The table size is doubled upon further contention until
	'     * reaching the nearest power of two greater than or equal to the
	'     * number of CPUS. Table slots remain empty (null) until they are
	'     * needed.
	'     *
	'     * A single spinlock ("cellsBusy") is used for initializing and
	'     * resizing the table, as well as populating slots with new Cells.
	'     * There is no need for a blocking lock; when the lock is not
	'     * available, threads try other slots (or the base).  During these
	'     * retries, there is increased contention and reduced locality,
	'     * which is still better than alternatives.
	'     *
	'     * The Thread probe fields maintained via ThreadLocalRandom serve
	'     * as per-thread hash codes. We let them remain uninitialized as
	'     * zero (if they come in this way) until they contend at slot
	'     * 0. They are then initialized to values that typically do not
	'     * often conflict with others.  Contention and/or table collisions
	'     * are indicated by failed CASes when performing an update
	'     * operation. Upon a collision, if the table size is less than
	'     * the capacity, it is doubled in size unless some other thread
	'     * holds the lock. If a hashed slot is empty, and lock is
	'     * available, a new Cell is created. Otherwise, if the slot
	'     * exists, a CAS is tried.  Retries proceed by "double hashing",
	'     * using a secondary hash (Marsaglia XorShift) to try to find a
	'     * free slot.
	'     *
	'     * The table size is capped because, when there are more threads
	'     * than CPUs, supposing that each thread were bound to a CPU,
	'     * there would exist a perfect hash function mapping threads to
	'     * slots that eliminates collisions. When we reach capacity, we
	'     * search for this mapping by randomly varying the hash codes of
	'     * colliding threads.  Because search is random, and collisions
	'     * only become known via CAS failures, convergence can be slow,
	'     * and because threads are typically not bound to CPUS forever,
	'     * may not occur at all. However, despite these limitations,
	'     * observed contention rates are typically low in these cases.
	'     *
	'     * It is possible for a Cell to become unused when threads that
	'     * once hashed to it terminate, as well as in the case where
	'     * doubling the table causes no thread to hash to it under
	'     * expanded mask.  We do not try to detect or remove such cells,
	'     * under the assumption that for long-running instances, observed
	'     * contention levels will recur, so the cells will eventually be
	'     * needed again; and for short-lived ones, it does not matter.
