	''' <summary>
	''' One or more variables that together maintain a running {@code double}
	''' value updated using a supplied function.  When updates (method
	''' <seealso cref="#accumulate"/>) are contended across threads, the set of variables
	''' may grow dynamically to reduce contention.  Method <seealso cref="#get"/>
	''' (or, equivalently, <seealso cref="#doubleValue"/>) returns the current value
	''' across the variables maintaining updates.
	''' 
	''' <p>This class is usually preferable to alternatives when multiple
	''' threads update a common value that is used for purposes such as
	''' summary statistics that are frequently updated but less frequently
	''' read.
	''' 
	''' <p>The supplied accumulator function should be side-effect-free,
	''' since it may be re-applied when attempted updates fail due to
	''' contention among threads. The function is applied with the current
	''' value as its first argument, and the given update as the second
	''' argument.  For example, to maintain a running maximum value, you
	''' could supply {@code Double::max} along with {@code
	''' java.lang.[Double].NEGATIVE_INFINITY} as the identity. The order of
	''' accumulation within or across threads is not guaranteed. Thus, this
	''' class may not be applicable if numerical stability is required,
	''' especially when combining values of substantially different orders
	''' of magnitude.
	''' 
	''' <p>Class <seealso cref="DoubleAdder"/> provides analogs of the functionality
	''' of this class for the common special case of maintaining sums.  The
	''' call {@code new DoubleAdder()} is equivalent to {@code new
	''' DoubleAccumulator((x, y) -> x + y, 0.0)}.
	''' 
	''' <p>This class extends <seealso cref="Number"/>, but does <em>not</em> define
	''' methods such as {@code equals}, {@code hashCode} and {@code
	''' compareTo} because instances are expected to be mutated, and so are
	''' not useful as collection keys.
