	''' <summary>
	''' A synchronizer that may be exclusively owned by a thread.  This
	''' class provides a basis for creating locks and related synchronizers
	''' that may entail a notion of ownership.  The
	''' {@code AbstractOwnableSynchronizer} class itself does not manage or
	''' use this information. However, subclasses and tools may use
	''' appropriately maintained values to help control and monitor access
	''' and provide diagnostics.
