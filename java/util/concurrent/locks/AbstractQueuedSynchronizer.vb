	''' <summary>
	''' Provides a framework for implementing blocking locks and related
	''' synchronizers (semaphores, events, etc) that rely on
	''' first-in-first-out (FIFO) wait queues.  This class is designed to
	''' be a useful basis for most kinds of synchronizers that rely on a
	''' single atomic {@code int} value to represent state. Subclasses
	''' must define the protected methods that change this state, and which
	''' define what that state means in terms of this object being acquired
	''' or released.  Given these, the other methods in this class carry
	''' out all queuing and blocking mechanics. Subclasses can maintain
	''' other state fields, but only the atomically updated {@code int}
	''' value manipulated using methods <seealso cref="#getState"/>, {@link
	''' #setState} and <seealso cref="#compareAndSetState"/> is tracked with respect
	''' to synchronization.
	''' 
	''' <p>Subclasses should be defined as non-public internal helper
	''' classes that are used to implement the synchronization properties
	''' of their enclosing class.  Class
	''' {@code AbstractQueuedSynchronizer} does not implement any
	''' synchronization interface.  Instead it defines methods such as
	''' <seealso cref="#acquireInterruptibly"/> that can be invoked as
	''' appropriate by concrete locks and related synchronizers to
	''' implement their public methods.
	''' 
	''' <p>This class supports either or both a default <em>exclusive</em>
	''' mode and a <em>shared</em> mode. When acquired in exclusive mode,
	''' attempted acquires by other threads cannot succeed. Shared mode
	''' acquires by multiple threads may (but need not) succeed. This class
	''' does not &quot;understand&quot; these differences except in the
	''' mechanical sense that when a shared mode acquire succeeds, the next
	''' waiting thread (if one exists) must also determine whether it can
	''' acquire as well. Threads waiting in the different modes share the
	''' same FIFO queue. Usually, implementation subclasses support only
	''' one of these modes, but both can come into play for example in a
	''' <seealso cref="ReadWriteLock"/>. Subclasses that support only exclusive or
	''' only shared modes need not define the methods supporting the unused mode.
	''' 
	''' <p>This class defines a nested <seealso cref="ConditionObject"/> class that
	''' can be used as a <seealso cref="Condition"/> implementation by subclasses
	''' supporting exclusive mode for which method {@link
	''' #isHeldExclusively} reports whether synchronization is exclusively
	''' held with respect to the current thread, method <seealso cref="#release"/>
	''' invoked with the current <seealso cref="#getState"/> value fully releases
	''' this object, and <seealso cref="#acquire"/>, given this saved state value,
	''' eventually restores this object to its previous acquired state.  No
	''' {@code AbstractQueuedSynchronizer} method otherwise creates such a
	''' condition, so if this constraint cannot be met, do not use it.  The
	''' behavior of <seealso cref="ConditionObject"/> depends of course on the
	''' semantics of its synchronizer implementation.
	''' 
	''' <p>This class provides inspection, instrumentation, and monitoring
	''' methods for the internal queue, as well as similar methods for
	''' condition objects. These can be exported as desired into classes
	''' using an {@code AbstractQueuedSynchronizer} for their
	''' synchronization mechanics.
	''' 
	''' <p>Serialization of this class stores only the underlying atomic
	''' integer maintaining state, so deserialized objects have empty
	''' thread queues. Typical subclasses requiring serializability will
	''' define a {@code readObject} method that restores this to a known
	''' initial state upon deserialization.
	''' 
	''' <h3>Usage</h3>
	''' 
	''' <p>To use this class as the basis of a synchronizer, redefine the
	''' following methods, as applicable, by inspecting and/or modifying
	''' the synchronization state using <seealso cref="#getState"/>, {@link
	''' #setState} and/or <seealso cref="#compareAndSetState"/>:
	''' 
	''' <ul>
	''' <li> <seealso cref="#tryAcquire"/>
	''' <li> <seealso cref="#tryRelease"/>
	''' <li> <seealso cref="#tryAcquireShared"/>
	''' <li> <seealso cref="#tryReleaseShared"/>
	''' <li> <seealso cref="#isHeldExclusively"/>
	''' </ul>
	''' 
	''' Each of these methods by default throws {@link
	''' UnsupportedOperationException}.  Implementations of these methods
	''' must be internally thread-safe, and should in general be short and
	''' not block. Defining these methods is the <em>only</em> supported
	''' means of using this class. All other methods are declared
	''' {@code final} because they cannot be independently varied.
	''' 
	''' <p>You may also find the inherited methods from {@link
	''' AbstractOwnableSynchronizer} useful to keep track of the thread
	''' owning an exclusive synchronizer.  You are encouraged to use them
	''' -- this enables monitoring and diagnostic tools to assist users in
	''' determining which threads hold locks.
	''' 
	''' <p>Even though this class is based on an internal FIFO queue, it
	''' does not automatically enforce FIFO acquisition policies.  The core
	''' of exclusive synchronization takes the form:
	''' 
	''' <pre>
	''' Acquire:
	'''     while (!tryAcquire(arg)) {
	'''        <em>enqueue thread if it is not already queued</em>;
	'''        <em>possibly block current thread</em>;
	'''     }
	''' 
	''' Release:
	'''     if (tryRelease(arg))
	'''        <em>unblock the first queued thread</em>;
	''' </pre>
	''' 
	''' (Shared mode is similar but may involve cascading signals.)
	''' 
	''' <p id="barging">Because checks in acquire are invoked before
	''' enqueuing, a newly acquiring thread may <em>barge</em> ahead of
	''' others that are blocked and queued.  However, you can, if desired,
	''' define {@code tryAcquire} and/or {@code tryAcquireShared} to
	''' disable barging by internally invoking one or more of the inspection
	''' methods, thereby providing a <em>fair</em> FIFO acquisition order.
	''' In particular, most fair synchronizers can define {@code tryAcquire}
	''' to return {@code false} if <seealso cref="#hasQueuedPredecessors"/> (a method
	''' specifically designed to be used by fair synchronizers) returns
	''' {@code true}.  Other variations are possible.
	''' 
	''' <p>Throughput and scalability are generally highest for the
	''' default barging (also known as <em>greedy</em>,
	''' <em>renouncement</em>, and <em>convoy-avoidance</em>) strategy.
	''' While this is not guaranteed to be fair or starvation-free, earlier
	''' queued threads are allowed to recontend before later queued
	''' threads, and each recontention has an unbiased chance to succeed
	''' against incoming threads.  Also, while acquires do not
	''' &quot;spin&quot; in the usual sense, they may perform multiple
	''' invocations of {@code tryAcquire} interspersed with other
	''' computations before blocking.  This gives most of the benefits of
	''' spins when exclusive synchronization is only briefly held, without
	''' most of the liabilities when it isn't. If so desired, you can
	''' augment this by preceding calls to acquire methods with
	''' "fast-path" checks, possibly prechecking <seealso cref="#hasContended"/>
	''' and/or <seealso cref="#hasQueuedThreads"/> to only do so if the synchronizer
	''' is likely not to be contended.
	''' 
	''' <p>This class provides an efficient and scalable basis for
	''' synchronization in part by specializing its range of use to
	''' synchronizers that can rely on {@code int} state, acquire, and
	''' release parameters, and an internal FIFO wait queue. When this does
	''' not suffice, you can build synchronizers from a lower level using
	''' <seealso cref="java.util.concurrent.atomic atomic"/> classes, your own custom
	''' <seealso cref="java.util.Queue"/> classes, and <seealso cref="LockSupport"/> blocking
	''' support.
	''' 
	''' <h3>Usage Examples</h3>
	''' 
	''' <p>Here is a non-reentrant mutual exclusion lock class that uses
	''' the value zero to represent the unlocked state, and one to
	''' represent the locked state. While a non-reentrant lock
	''' does not strictly require recording of the current owner
	''' thread, this class does so anyway to make usage easier to monitor.
	''' It also supports conditions and exposes
	''' one of the instrumentation methods:
	''' 
	'''  <pre> {@code
	''' class Mutex implements Lock, java.io.Serializable {
	''' 
	'''   // Our internal helper class
	'''   private static class Sync extends AbstractQueuedSynchronizer {
	'''     // Reports whether in locked state
	'''     protected boolean isHeldExclusively() {
	'''       return getState() == 1;
	'''     }
	''' 
	'''     // Acquires the lock if state is zero
	'''     public boolean tryAcquire(int acquires) {
	'''       assert acquires == 1; // Otherwise unused
	'''       if (compareAndSetState(0, 1)) {
	'''         setExclusiveOwnerThread(Thread.currentThread());
	'''         return true;
	'''       }
	'''       return false;
	'''     }
	''' 
	'''     // Releases the lock by setting state to zero
	'''     protected boolean tryRelease(int releases) {
	'''       assert releases == 1; // Otherwise unused
	'''       if (getState() == 0) throw new IllegalMonitorStateException();
	'''       setExclusiveOwnerThread(null);
	'''       setState(0);
	'''       return true;
	'''     }
	''' 
	'''     // Provides a Condition
	'''     Condition newCondition() { return new ConditionObject(); }
	''' 
	'''     // Deserializes properly
	'''     private  Sub  readObject(ObjectInputStream s)
	'''         throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
	'''       s.defaultReadObject();
	'''       setState(0); // reset to unlocked state

		''' <summary>
		''' Wait queue node class.
		''' 
		''' <p>The wait queue is a variant of a "CLH" (Craig, Landin, and
		''' Hagersten) lock queue. CLH locks are normally used for
		''' spinlocks.  We instead use them for blocking synchronizers, but
		''' use the same basic tactic of holding some of the control
		''' information about a thread in the predecessor of its node.  A
		''' "status" field in each node keeps track of whether a thread
		''' should block.  A node is signalled when its predecessor
		''' releases.  Each node of the queue otherwise serves as a
		''' specific-notification-style monitor holding a single waiting
		''' thread. The status field does NOT control whether threads are
		''' granted locks etc though.  A thread may try to acquire if it is
		''' first in the queue. But being first does not guarantee success;
		''' it only gives the right to contend.  So the currently released
		''' contender thread may need to rewait.
		''' 
		''' <p>To enqueue into a CLH lock, you atomically splice it in as new
		''' tail. To dequeue, you just set the head field.
		''' <pre>
		'''      +------+  prev +-----+       +-----+
		''' head |      | <---- |     | <---- |     |  tail
		'''      +------+       +-----+       +-----+
		''' </pre>
		''' 
		''' <p>Insertion into a CLH queue requires only a single atomic
		''' operation on "tail", so there is a simple atomic point of
		''' demarcation from unqueued to queued. Similarly, dequeuing
		''' involves only updating the "head". However, it takes a bit
		''' more work for nodes to determine who their successors are,
		''' in part to deal with possible cancellation due to timeouts
		''' and interrupts.
		''' 
		''' <p>The "prev" links (not used in original CLH locks), are mainly
		''' needed to handle cancellation. If a node is cancelled, its
		''' successor is (normally) relinked to a non-cancelled
		''' predecessor. For explanation of similar mechanics in the case
		''' of spin locks, see the papers by Scott and Scherer at
		''' http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/scott/synchronization/
		''' 
		''' <p>We also use "next" links to implement blocking mechanics.
		''' The thread id for each node is kept in its own node, so a
		''' predecessor signals the next node to wake up by traversing
		''' next link to determine which thread it is.  Determination of
		''' successor must avoid races with newly queued nodes to set
		''' the "next" fields of their predecessors.  This is solved
		''' when necessary by checking backwards from the atomically
		''' updated "tail" when a node's successor appears to be null.
		''' (Or, said differently, the next-links are an optimization
		''' so that we don't usually need a backward scan.)
		''' 
		''' <p>Cancellation introduces some conservatism to the basic
		''' algorithms.  Since we must poll for cancellation of other
		''' nodes, we can miss noticing whether a cancelled node is
		''' ahead or behind us. This is dealt with by always unparking
		''' successors upon cancellation, allowing them to stabilize on
		''' a new predecessor, unless we can identify an uncancelled
		''' predecessor who will carry this responsibility.
		''' 
		''' <p>CLH queues need a dummy header node to get started. But
		''' we don't create them on construction, because it would be wasted
		''' effort if there is never contention. Instead, the node
		''' is constructed and head and tail pointers are set upon first
		''' contention.
		''' 
		''' <p>Threads waiting on Conditions use the same nodes, but
		''' use an additional link. Conditions only need to link nodes
		''' in simple (non-concurrent) linked queues because they are
		''' only accessed when exclusively held.  Upon await, a node is
		''' inserted into a condition queue.  Upon signal, the node is
		''' transferred to the main queue.  A special value of status
		''' field is used to mark which queue a node is on.

		''' Scherer and Michael Scott, along with members of JSR-166
