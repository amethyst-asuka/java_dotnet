	''' <summary>
	''' A capability-based lock with three modes for controlling read/write
	''' access.  The state of a StampedLock consists of a version and mode.
	''' Lock acquisition methods return a stamp that represents and
	''' controls access with respect to a lock state; "try" versions of
	''' these methods may instead return the special value zero to
	''' represent failure to acquire access. Lock release and conversion
	''' methods require stamps as arguments, and fail if they do not match
	''' the state of the lock. The three modes are:
	''' 
	''' <ul>
	''' 
	'''  <li><b>Writing.</b> Method <seealso cref="#writeLock"/> possibly blocks
	'''   waiting for exclusive access, returning a stamp that can be used
	'''   in method <seealso cref="#unlockWrite"/> to release the lock. Untimed and
	'''   timed versions of {@code tryWriteLock} are also provided. When
	'''   the lock is held in write mode, no read locks may be obtained,
	'''   and all optimistic read validations will fail.  </li>
	''' 
	'''  <li><b>Reading.</b> Method <seealso cref="#readLock"/> possibly blocks
	'''   waiting for non-exclusive access, returning a stamp that can be
	'''   used in method <seealso cref="#unlockRead"/> to release the lock. Untimed
	'''   and timed versions of {@code tryReadLock} are also provided. </li>
	''' 
	'''  <li><b>Optimistic Reading.</b> Method <seealso cref="#tryOptimisticRead"/>
	'''   returns a non-zero stamp only if the lock is not currently held
	'''   in write mode. Method <seealso cref="#validate"/> returns true if the lock
	'''   has not been acquired in write mode since obtaining a given
	'''   stamp.  This mode can be thought of as an extremely weak version
	'''   of a read-lock, that can be broken by a writer at any time.  The
	'''   use of optimistic mode for short read-only code segments often
	'''   reduces contention and improves throughput.  However, its use is
	'''   inherently fragile.  Optimistic read sections should only read
	'''   fields and hold them in local variables for later use after
	'''   validation. Fields read while in optimistic mode may be wildly
	'''   inconsistent, so usage applies only when you are familiar enough
	'''   with data representations to check consistency and/or repeatedly
	'''   invoke method {@code validate()}.  For example, such steps are
	'''   typically required when first reading an object or array
	'''   reference, and then accessing one of its fields, elements or
	'''   methods. </li>
	''' 
	''' </ul>
	''' 
	''' <p>This class also supports methods that conditionally provide
	''' conversions across the three modes. For example, method {@link
	''' #tryConvertToWriteLock} attempts to "upgrade" a mode, returning
	''' a valid write stamp if (1) already in writing mode (2) in reading
	''' mode and there are no other readers or (3) in optimistic mode and
	''' the lock is available. The forms of these methods are designed to
	''' help reduce some of the code bloat that otherwise occurs in
	''' retry-based designs.
	''' 
	''' <p>StampedLocks are designed for use as internal utilities in the
	''' development of thread-safe components. Their use relies on
	''' knowledge of the internal properties of the data, objects, and
	''' methods they are protecting.  They are not reentrant, so locked
	''' bodies should not call other unknown methods that may try to
	''' re-acquire locks (although you may pass a stamp to other methods
	''' that can use or convert it).  The use of read lock modes relies on
	''' the associated code sections being side-effect-free.  Unvalidated
	''' optimistic read sections cannot call methods that are not known to
	''' tolerate potential inconsistencies.  Stamps use finite
	''' representations, and are not cryptographically secure (i.e., a
	''' valid stamp may be guessable). Stamp values may recycle after (no
	''' sooner than) one year of continuous operation. A stamp held without
	''' use or validation for longer than this period may fail to validate
	''' correctly.  StampedLocks are serializable, but always deserialize
	''' into initial unlocked state, so they are not useful for remote
	''' locking.
	''' 
	''' <p>The scheduling policy of StampedLock does not consistently
	''' prefer readers over writers or vice versa.  All "try" methods are
	''' best-effort and do not necessarily conform to any scheduling or
	''' fairness policy. A zero return from any "try" method for acquiring
	''' or converting locks does not carry any information about the state
	''' of the lock; a subsequent invocation may succeed.
	''' 
	''' <p>Because it supports coordinated usage across multiple lock
	''' modes, this class does not directly implement the <seealso cref="Lock"/> or
	''' <seealso cref="ReadWriteLock"/> interfaces. However, a StampedLock may be
	''' viewed <seealso cref="#asReadLock()"/>, <seealso cref="#asWriteLock()"/>, or {@link
	''' #asReadWriteLock()} in applications requiring only the associated
	''' set of functionality.
	''' 
	''' <p><b>Sample Usage.</b> The following illustrates some usage idioms
	''' in a class that maintains simple two-dimensional points. The sample
	''' code illustrates some try/catch conventions even though they are
	''' not strictly needed here because no exceptions can occur in their
	''' bodies.<br>
	''' 
	'''  <pre>{@code
	''' class Point {
	'''   private double x, y;
	'''   private final StampedLock sl = new StampedLock();
	''' 
	'''   void move(double deltaX, double deltaY) { // an exclusively locked method
	'''     long stamp = sl.writeLock();
	'''     try {
	'''       x += deltaX;
	'''       y += deltaY;
	'''     } finally {
	'''       sl.unlockWrite(stamp);
	'''     }
	'''   }

	'''   double distanceFromOrigin() { // A read-only method
	'''     long stamp = sl.tryOptimisticRead();

	Public Class StampedLock
	'    
	'     * Algorithmic notes:
	'     *
	'     * The design employs elements of Sequence locks
	'     * (as used in linux kernels; see Lameter's
	'     * http://www.lameter.com/gelato2005.pdf
	'     * and elsewhere; see
	'     * Boehm's http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2012/HPL-2012-68.html)
	'     * and Ordered RW locks (see Shirako et al
	'     * http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2312015)
	'     *
	'     * Conceptually, the primary state of the lock includes a sequence
	'     * number that is odd when write-locked and even otherwise.
	'     * However, this is offset by a reader count that is non-zero when
	'     * read-locked.  The read count is ignored when validating
	'     * "optimistic" seqlock-reader-style stamps.  Because we must use
	'     * a small finite number of bits (currently 7) for readers, a
	'     * supplementary reader overflow word is used when the number of
	'     * readers exceeds the count field. We do this by treating the max
	'     * reader count value (RBITS) as a spinlock protecting overflow
	'     * updates.
	'     *
	'     * Waiters use a modified form of CLH lock used in
	'     * AbstractQueuedSynchronizer (see its internal documentation for
	'     * a fuller account), where each node is tagged (field mode) as
	'     * either a reader or writer. Sets of waiting readers are grouped
	'     * (linked) under a common node (field cowait) so act as a single
	'     * node with respect to most CLH mechanics.  By virtue of the
	'     * queue structure, wait nodes need not actually carry sequence
	'     * numbers; we know each is greater than its predecessor.  This
	'     * simplifies the scheduling policy to a mainly-FIFO scheme that
	'     * incorporates elements of Phase-Fair locks (see Brandenburg &
	'     * Anderson, especially http://www.cs.unc.edu/~bbb/diss/).  In
	'     * particular, we use the phase-fair anti-barging rule: If an
	'     * incoming reader arrives while read lock is held but there is a
	'     * queued writer, this incoming reader is queued.  (This rule is
	'     * responsible for some of the complexity of method acquireRead,
	'     * but without it, the lock becomes highly unfair.) Method release
	'     * does not (and sometimes cannot) itself wake up cowaiters. This
	'     * is done by the primary thread, but helped by any other threads
	'     * with nothing better to do in methods acquireRead and
	'     * acquireWrite.
	'     *
	'     * These rules apply to threads actually queued. All tryLock forms
	'     * opportunistically try to acquire locks regardless of preference
	'     * rules, and so may "barge" their way in.  Randomized spinning is
	'     * used in the acquire methods to reduce (increasingly expensive)
	'     * context switching while also avoiding sustained memory
	'     * thrashing among many threads.  We limit spins to the head of
	'     * queue. A thread spin-waits up to SPINS times (where each
	'     * iteration decreases spin count with 50% probability) before
	'     * blocking. If, upon wakening it fails to obtain lock, and is
	'     * still (or becomes) the first waiting thread (which indicates
	'     * that some other thread barged and obtained lock), it escalates
	'     * spins (up to MAX_HEAD_SPINS) to reduce the likelihood of
	'     * continually losing to barging threads.
	'     *
	'     * Nearly all of these mechanics are carried out in methods
	'     * acquireWrite and acquireRead, that, as typical of such code,
	'     * sprawl out because actions and retries rely on consistent sets
	'     * of locally cached reads.
	'     *
	'     * As noted in Boehm's paper (above), sequence validation (mainly
	'     * method validate()) requires stricter ordering rules than apply
	'     * to normal volatile reads (of "state").  To force orderings of
	'     * reads before a validation and the validation itself in those
	'     * cases where this is not already forced, we use
	'     * Unsafe.loadFence.
	'     *
	'     * The memory layout keeps lock state and queue pointers together
	'     * (normally on the same cache line). This usually works well for
	'     * read-mostly loads. In most other cases, the natural tendency of
	'     * adaptive-spin CLH locks to reduce memory contention lessens
	'     * motivation to further spread out contended locations, but might
	'     * be subject to future improvements.
