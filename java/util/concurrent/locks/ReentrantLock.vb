	''' <summary>
	''' A reentrant mutual exclusion <seealso cref="Lock"/> with the same basic
	''' behavior and semantics as the implicit monitor lock accessed using
	''' {@code synchronized} methods and statements, but with extended
	''' capabilities.
	''' 
	''' <p>A {@code ReentrantLock} is <em>owned</em> by the thread last
	''' successfully locking, but not yet unlocking it. A thread invoking
	''' {@code lock} will return, successfully acquiring the lock, when
	''' the lock is not owned by another thread. The method will return
	''' immediately if the current thread already owns the lock. This can
	''' be checked using methods <seealso cref="#isHeldByCurrentThread"/>, and {@link
	''' #getHoldCount}.
	''' 
	''' <p>The constructor for this class accepts an optional
	''' <em>fairness</em> parameter.  When set {@code true}, under
	''' contention, locks favor granting access to the longest-waiting
	''' thread.  Otherwise this lock does not guarantee any particular
	''' access order.  Programs using fair locks accessed by many threads
	''' may display lower overall throughput (i.e., are slower; often much
	''' slower) than those using the default setting, but have smaller
	''' variances in times to obtain locks and guarantee lack of
	''' starvation. Note however, that fairness of locks does not guarantee
	''' fairness of thread scheduling. Thus, one of many threads using a
	''' fair lock may obtain it multiple times in succession while other
	''' active threads are not progressing and not currently holding the
	''' lock.
	''' Also note that the untimed <seealso cref="#tryLock()"/> method does not
	''' honor the fairness setting. It will succeed if the lock
	''' is available even if other threads are waiting.
	''' 
	''' <p>It is recommended practice to <em>always</em> immediately
	''' follow a call to {@code lock} with a {@code try} block, most
	''' typically in a before/after construction such as:
	''' 
	'''  <pre> {@code
	''' class X {
	'''   private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
	'''   // ...
	''' 
	'''   public  Sub  m() {
	'''     lock.lock();  // block until condition holds
	'''     try {
	'''       // ... method body
	'''     } finally {
	'''       lock.unlock()
	'''     }
	'''   }
	''' }}</pre>
	''' 
	''' <p>In addition to implementing the <seealso cref="Lock"/> interface, this
	''' class defines a number of {@code public} and {@code protected}
	''' methods for inspecting the state of the lock.  Some of these
	''' methods are only useful for instrumentation and monitoring.
	''' 
	''' <p>Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
	''' locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
	''' its state when serialized.
	''' 
	''' <p>This lock supports a maximum of 2147483647 recursive locks by
	''' the same thread. Attempts to exceed this limit result in
	''' <seealso cref="Error"/> throws from locking methods.
