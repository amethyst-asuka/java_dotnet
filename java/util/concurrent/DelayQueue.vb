	''' <summary>
	''' An unbounded <seealso cref="BlockingQueue blocking queue"/> of
	''' {@code Delayed} elements, in which an element can only be taken
	''' when its delay has expired.  The <em>head</em> of the queue is that
	''' {@code Delayed} element whose delay expired furthest in the
	''' past.  If no delay has expired there is no head and {@code poll}
	''' will return {@code null}. Expiration occurs when an element's
	''' {@code getDelay(TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS)} method returns a value less
	''' than or equal to zero.  Even though unexpired elements cannot be
	''' removed using {@code take} or {@code poll}, they are otherwise
	''' treated as normal elements. For example, the {@code size} method
	''' returns the count of both expired and unexpired elements.
	''' This queue does not permit null elements.
	''' 
	''' <p>This class and its iterator implement all of the
	''' <em>optional</em> methods of the <seealso cref="Collection"/> and {@link
	''' Iterator} interfaces.  The Iterator provided in method {@link
	''' #iterator()} is <em>not</em> guaranteed to traverse the elements of
	''' the DelayQueue in any particular order.
	''' 
	''' <p>This class is a member of the
	''' <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">

		''' minimize unnecessary timed waiting.  When a thread becomes
		''' the leader, it waits only for the next delay to elapse, but

		''' signal some other thread before returning from take() or
