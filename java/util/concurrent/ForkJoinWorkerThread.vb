	''' <summary>
	''' A thread managed by a <seealso cref="ForkJoinPool"/>, which executes
	''' <seealso cref="ForkJoinTask"/>s.
	''' This class is subclassable solely for the sake of adding
	''' functionality -- there are no overridable methods dealing with
	''' scheduling or execution.  However, you can override initialization
	''' and termination methods surrounding the main task processing loop.
	''' If you do create such a subclass, you will also need to supply a
	''' custom <seealso cref="ForkJoinPool.ForkJoinWorkerThreadFactory"/> to
	''' <seealso cref="ForkJoinPool#ForkJoinPool use it"/> in a {@code ForkJoinPool}.

	Public Class ForkJoinWorkerThread
		Inherits Thread

	'    
	'     * ForkJoinWorkerThreads are managed by ForkJoinPools and perform
	'     * ForkJoinTasks. For explanation, see the internal documentation
	'     * of class ForkJoinPool.
	'     *
	'     * This class just maintains links to its pool and WorkQueue.  The
	'     * pool field is set immediately upon construction, but the
	'     * workQueue field is not set until a call to registerWorker
	'     * completes. This leads to a visibility race, that is tolerated
	'     * by requiring that the workQueue field is only accessed by the
	'     * owning thread.
	'     *
	'     * Support for (non-public) subclass InnocuousForkJoinWorkerThread
	'     * requires that we break quite a lot of encapsulation (via Unsafe)
	'     * both here and in the subclass to access and set Thread fields.
