	''' <summary>
	''' A <seealso cref="BlockingQueue blocking queue"/> in which each insert
	''' operation must wait for a corresponding remove operation by another
	''' thread, and vice versa.  A synchronous queue does not have any
	''' internal capacity, not even a capacity of one.  You cannot
	''' {@code peek} at a synchronous queue because an element is only
	''' present when you try to remove it; you cannot insert an element
	''' (using any method) unless another thread is trying to remove it;
	''' you cannot iterate as there is nothing to iterate.  The
	''' <em>head</em> of the queue is the element that the first queued
	''' inserting thread is trying to add to the queue; if there is no such
	''' queued thread then no element is available for removal and
	''' {@code poll()} will return {@code null}.  For purposes of other
	''' {@code Collection} methods (for example {@code contains}), a
	''' {@code SynchronousQueue} acts as an empty collection.  This queue
	''' does not permit {@code null} elements.
	''' 
	''' <p>Synchronous queues are similar to rendezvous channels used in
	''' CSP and Ada. They are well suited for handoff designs, in which an
	''' object running in one thread must sync up with an object running
	''' in another thread in order to hand it some information, event, or
	''' task.
	''' 
	''' <p>This class supports an optional fairness policy for ordering
	''' waiting producer and consumer threads.  By default, this ordering
	''' is not guaranteed. However, a queue constructed with fairness set
	''' to {@code true} grants threads access in FIFO order.
	''' 
	''' <p>This class and its iterator implement all of the
	''' <em>optional</em> methods of the <seealso cref="Collection"/> and {@link
	''' Iterator} interfaces.

	'    
	'     * This class implements extensions of the dual stack and dual
	'     * queue algorithms described in "Nonblocking Concurrent Objects
	'     * with Condition Synchronization", by W. N. Scherer III and
	'     * M. L. Scott.  18th Annual Conf. on Distributed Computing,
	'     * Oct. 2004 (see also
	'     * http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/scott/synchronization/pseudocode/duals.html).
	'     * The (Lifo) stack is used for non-fair mode, and the (Fifo)
	'     * queue for fair mode. The performance of the two is generally
	'     * similar. Fifo usually supports higher throughput under
	'     * contention but Lifo maintains higher thread locality in common
	'     * applications.
	'     *
	'     * A dual queue (and similarly stack) is one that at any given
	'     * time either holds "data" -- items provided by put operations,
	'     * or "requests" -- slots representing take operations, or is
	'     * empty. A call to "fulfill" (i.e., a call requesting an item
	'     * from a queue holding data or vice versa) dequeues a
	'     * complementary node.  The most interesting feature of these
	'     * queues is that any operation can figure out which mode the
	'     * queue is in, and act accordingly without needing locks.
	'     *
	'     * Both the queue and stack extend abstract class Transferer
	'     * defining the single method transfer that does a put or a
	'     * take. These are unified into a single method because in dual
	'     * data structures, the put and take operations are symmetrical,
	'     * so nearly all code can be combined. The resulting transfer
	'     * methods are on the long side, but are easier to follow than
	'     * they would be if broken up into nearly-duplicated parts.
	'     *
	'     * The queue and stack data structures share many conceptual
	'     * similarities but very few concrete details. For simplicity,
	'     * they are kept distinct so that they can later evolve
	'     * separately.
	'     *
	'     * The algorithms here differ from the versions in the above paper
	'     * in extending them for use in synchronous queues, as well as
	'     * dealing with cancellation. The main differences include:
	'     *
	'     *  1. The original algorithms used bit-marked pointers, but
	'     *     the ones here use mode bits in nodes, leading to a number
	'     *     of further adaptations.
	'     *  2. SynchronousQueues must block threads waiting to become
	'     *     fulfilled.
	'     *  3. Support for cancellation via timeout and interrupts,
	'     *     including cleaning out cancelled nodes/threads
	'     *     from lists to avoid garbage retention and memory depletion.
	'     *
	'     * Blocking is mainly accomplished using LockSupport park/unpark,
	'     * except that nodes that appear to be the next ones to become
	'     * fulfilled first spin a bit (on multiprocessors only). On very
	'     * busy synchronous queues, spinning can dramatically improve
	'     * throughput. And on less busy ones, the amount of spinning is
	'     * small enough not to be noticeable.
	'     *
	'     * Cleaning is done in different ways in queues vs stacks.  For
	'     * queues, we can almost always remove a node immediately in O(1)
	'     * time (modulo retries for consistency checks) when it is
	'     * cancelled. But if it may be pinned as the current tail, it must
	'     * wait until some subsequent cancellation. For stacks, we need a
	'     * potentially O(n) traversal to be sure that we can remove the
	'     * node, but this can run concurrently with other threads
	'     * accessing the stack.
	'     *
	'     * While garbage collection takes care of most node reclamation
	'     * issues that otherwise complicate nonblocking algorithms, care
	'     * is taken to "forget" references to data, other nodes, and
	'     * threads that might be held on to long-term by blocked
	'     * threads. In cases where setting to null would otherwise
	'     * conflict with main algorithms, this is done by changing a
	'     * node's link to now point to the node itself. This doesn't arise
	'     * much for Stack nodes (because blocked threads do not hang on to
	'     * old head pointers), but references in Queue nodes must be
	'     * aggressively forgotten to avoid reachability of everything any
	'     * node has ever referred to since arrival.
