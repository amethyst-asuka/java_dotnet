	''' <summary>
	''' A {@code Future} represents the result of an asynchronous
	''' computation.  Methods are provided to check if the computation is
	''' complete, to wait for its completion, and to retrieve the result of
	''' the computation.  The result can only be retrieved using method
	''' {@code get} when the computation has completed, blocking if
	''' necessary until it is ready.  Cancellation is performed by the
	''' {@code cancel} method.  Additional methods are provided to
	''' determine if the task completed normally or was cancelled. Once a
	''' computation has completed, the computation cannot be cancelled.
	''' If you would like to use a {@code Future} for the sake
	''' of cancellability but not provide a usable result, you can
	''' declare types of the form {@code Future<?>} and
	''' return {@code null} as a result of the underlying task.
	''' 
	''' <p>
	''' <b>Sample Usage</b> (Note that the following classes are all
	''' made-up.)
	''' <pre> {@code
	''' interface ArchiveSearcher { String search(String target); }
	''' class App {
	'''   ExecutorService executor = ...
	'''   ArchiveSearcher searcher = ...
	'''   void showSearch(final String target)
	'''       throws InterruptedException {
	'''     Future<String> future
	'''       = executor.submit(new Callable<String>() {
	'''         public String call() {
	'''             return searcher.search(target);
	'''         }});
	'''     displayOtherThings(); // do other things while searching
	'''     try {
	'''       displayText(future.get()); // use future
	'''     } catch (ExecutionException ex) { cleanup(); return; }
	'''   }
	''' }}</pre>
	''' 
	''' The <seealso cref="FutureTask"/> class is an implementation of {@code Future} that
	''' implements {@code Runnable}, and so may be executed by an {@code Executor}.
	''' For example, the above construction with {@code submit} could be replaced by:
	'''  <pre> {@code
	''' FutureTask<String> future =
	'''   new FutureTask<String>(new Callable<String>() {
	'''     public String call() {
	'''       return searcher.search(target);
	'''   }});
	''' executor.execute(future);}</pre>
	''' 
	''' <p>Memory consistency effects: Actions taken by the asynchronous computation
	''' <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"> <i>happen-before</i></a>
	''' actions following the corresponding {@code Future.get()} in another thread.

		''' <summary>
		''' Attempts to cancel execution of this task.  This attempt will
