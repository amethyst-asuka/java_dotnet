	''' <summary>
	''' An optionally-bounded <seealso cref="BlockingQueue blocking queue"/> based on
	''' linked nodes.
	''' This queue orders elements FIFO (first-in-first-out).
	''' The <em>head</em> of the queue is that element that has been on the
	''' queue the longest time.
	''' The <em>tail</em> of the queue is that element that has been on the
	''' queue the shortest time. New elements
	''' are inserted at the tail of the queue, and the queue retrieval
	''' operations obtain elements at the head of the queue.
	''' Linked queues typically have higher throughput than array-based queues but
	''' less predictable performance in most concurrent applications.
	''' 
	''' <p>The optional capacity bound constructor argument serves as a
	''' way to prevent excessive queue expansion. The capacity, if unspecified,
	''' is equal to <seealso cref="Integer#MAX_VALUE"/>.  Linked nodes are
	''' dynamically created upon each insertion unless this would bring the
	''' queue above capacity.
	''' 
	''' <p>This class and its iterator implement all of the
	''' <em>optional</em> methods of the <seealso cref="Collection"/> and {@link
	''' Iterator} interfaces.
	''' 
	''' <p>This class is a member of the
	''' <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
	''' Java Collections Framework</a>.

	'    
	'     * A variant of the "two lock queue" algorithm.  The putLock gates
	'     * entry to put (and offer), and has an associated condition for
	'     * waiting puts.  Similarly for the takeLock.  The "count" field
	'     * that they both rely on is maintained as an atomic to avoid
	'     * needing to get both locks in most cases. Also, to minimize need
	'     * for puts to get takeLock and vice-versa, cascading notifies are
	'     * used. When a put notices that it has enabled at least one take,
	'     * it signals taker. That taker in turn signals others if more
	'     * items have been entered since the signal. And symmetrically for
	'     * takes signalling puts. Operations such as remove(Object) and
	'     * iterators acquire both locks.
	'     *
	'     * Visibility between writers and readers is provided as follows:
	'     *
	'     * Whenever an element is enqueued, the putLock is acquired and
	'     * count updated.  A subsequent reader guarantees visibility to the
	'     * enqueued Node by either acquiring the putLock (via fullyLock)
	'     * or by acquiring the takeLock, and then reading n = count.get();
	'     * this gives visibility to the first n items.
	'     *
	'     * To implement weakly consistent iterators, it appears we need to
	'     * keep all Nodes GC-reachable from a predecessor dequeued Node.
	'     * That would cause two problems:
	'     * - allow a rogue Iterator to cause unbounded memory retention
	'     * - cause cross-generational linking of old Nodes to new Nodes if
	'     *   a Node was tenured while live, which generational GCs have a
	'     *   hard time dealing with, causing repeated major collections.
	'     * However, only non-deleted Nodes need to be reachable from
	'     * dequeued Nodes, and reachability does not necessarily have to
	'     * be of the kind understood by the GC.  We use the trick of
	'     * linking a Node that has just been dequeued to itself.  Such a
	'     * self-link implicitly means to advance to head.next.
