	''' <summary>
	''' A <seealso cref="java.util.Queue"/> that additionally supports operations
	''' that wait for the queue to become non-empty when retrieving an
	''' element, and wait for space to become available in the queue when
	''' storing an element.
	''' 
	''' <p>{@code BlockingQueue} methods come in four forms, with different ways
	''' of handling operations that cannot be satisfied immediately, but may be
	''' satisfied at some point in the future:
	''' one throws an exception, the second returns a special value (either
	''' {@code null} or {@code false}, depending on the operation), the third
	''' blocks the current thread indefinitely until the operation can succeed,
	''' and the fourth blocks for only a given maximum time limit before giving
	''' up.  These methods are summarized in the following table:

	''' <p>A {@code BlockingQueue} does not accept {@code null} elements.
	''' Implementations throw {@code NullPointerException} on attempts
	''' to {@code add}, {@code put} or {@code offer} a {@code null}.  A
	''' {@code null} is used as a sentinel value to indicate failure of
	''' {@code poll} operations.
	''' 
	''' <p>A {@code BlockingQueue} may be capacity bounded. At any given
	''' time it may have a {@code remainingCapacity} beyond which no
	''' additional elements can be {@code put} without blocking.
	''' A {@code BlockingQueue} without any intrinsic capacity constraints always
	''' reports a remaining capacity of {@code  java.lang.[Integer].MAX_VALUE}.
	''' 
	''' <p>{@code BlockingQueue} implementations are designed to be used
	''' primarily for producer-consumer queues, but additionally support
	''' the <seealso cref="java.util.Collection"/> interface.  So, for example, it is
	''' possible to remove an arbitrary element from a queue using
	''' {@code remove(x)}. However, such operations are in general
	''' <em>not</em> performed very efficiently, and are intended for only
	''' occasional use, such as when a queued message is cancelled.
	''' 
	''' <p>{@code BlockingQueue} implementations are thread-safe.  All
	''' queuing methods achieve their effects atomically using internal
	''' locks or other forms of concurrency control. However, the
	''' <em>bulk</em> Collection operations {@code addAll},
	''' {@code containsAll}, {@code retainAll} and {@code removeAll} are
	''' <em>not</em> necessarily performed atomically unless specified
	''' otherwise in an implementation. So it is possible, for example, for
	''' {@code addAll(c)} to fail (throwing an exception) after adding
	''' only some of the elements in {@code c}.
	''' 
	''' <p>A {@code BlockingQueue} does <em>not</em> intrinsically support
	''' any kind of &quot;close&quot; or &quot;shutdown&quot; operation to
	''' indicate that no more items will be added.  The needs and usage of
	''' such features tend to be implementation-dependent. For example, a
	''' common tactic is for producers to insert special
	''' <em>end-of-stream</em> or <em>poison</em> objects, that are
	''' interpreted accordingly when taken by consumers.
	''' 
	''' <p>
	''' Usage example, based on a typical producer-consumer scenario.
	''' Note that a {@code BlockingQueue} can safely be used with multiple
	''' producers and multiple consumers.
	'''  <pre> {@code
	''' class Producer implements Runnable {
	'''   private final BlockingQueue queue;
	'''   Producer(BlockingQueue q) { queue = q; }

	'''       while (true) { queue.put(produce()); }
	'''     } catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ...}

	'''       while (true) { consume(queue.take()); }

	'''     new Thread(c1).start();
	'''     new Thread(c2).start();
	'''   }

	''' <p>Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent
	''' collections, actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a
	''' {@code BlockingQueue}
	''' <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
