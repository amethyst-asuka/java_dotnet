	''' <summary>
	''' A <seealso cref="ThreadPoolExecutor"/> that can additionally schedule
	''' commands to run after a given delay, or to execute
	''' periodically. This class is preferable to <seealso cref="java.util.Timer"/>
	''' when multiple worker threads are needed, or when the additional
	''' flexibility or capabilities of <seealso cref="ThreadPoolExecutor"/> (which
	''' this class extends) are required.
	''' 
	''' <p>Delayed tasks execute no sooner than they are enabled, but
	''' without any real-time guarantees about when, after they are
	''' enabled, they will commence. Tasks scheduled for exactly the same
	''' execution time are enabled in first-in-first-out (FIFO) order of
	''' submission.
	''' 
	''' <p>When a submitted task is cancelled before it is run, execution
	''' is suppressed. By default, such a cancelled task is not
	''' automatically removed from the work queue until its delay
	''' elapses. While this enables further inspection and monitoring, it
	''' may also cause unbounded retention of cancelled tasks. To avoid
	''' this, set <seealso cref="#setRemoveOnCancelPolicy"/> to {@code true}, which
	''' causes tasks to be immediately removed from the work queue at
	''' time of cancellation.
	''' 
	''' <p>Successive executions of a task scheduled via
	''' {@code scheduleAtFixedRate} or
	''' {@code scheduleWithFixedDelay} do not overlap. While different
	''' executions may be performed by different threads, the effects of
	''' prior executions <a
	''' href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
	''' those of subsequent ones.
	''' 
	''' <p>While this class inherits from <seealso cref="ThreadPoolExecutor"/>, a few
	''' of the inherited tuning methods are not useful for it. In
	''' particular, because it acts as a fixed-sized pool using
	''' {@code corePoolSize} threads and an unbounded queue, adjustments
	''' to {@code maximumPoolSize} have no useful effect. Additionally, it
	''' is almost never a good idea to set {@code corePoolSize} to zero or
	''' use {@code allowCoreThreadTimeOut} because this may leave the pool
	''' without threads to handle tasks once they become eligible to run.
	''' 
	''' <p><b>Extension notes:</b> This class overrides the
	''' <seealso cref="ThreadPoolExecutor#execute(Runnable) execute"/> and
	''' <seealso cref="AbstractExecutorService#submit(Runnable) submit"/>
	''' methods to generate internal <seealso cref="ScheduledFuture"/> objects to
	''' control per-task delays and scheduling.  To preserve
	''' functionality, any further overrides of these methods in
	''' subclasses must invoke superclass versions, which effectively
	''' disables additional task customization.  However, this class
	''' provides alternative protected extension method
	''' {@code decorateTask} (one version each for {@code Runnable} and
	''' {@code Callable}) that can be used to customize the concrete task
	''' types used to execute commands entered via {@code execute},
	''' {@code submit}, {@code schedule}, {@code scheduleAtFixedRate},
	''' and {@code scheduleWithFixedDelay}.  By default, a
	''' {@code ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} uses a task type extending
	''' <seealso cref="FutureTask"/>. However, this may be modified or replaced using
	''' subclasses of the form:
	''' 
	'''  <pre> {@code
	''' public class CustomScheduledExecutor extends ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor {
	''' 
	'''   static class CustomTask<V> implements RunnableScheduledFuture<V> { ... }
	''' 
	'''   protected <V> RunnableScheduledFuture<V> decorateTask(
	'''                Runnable r, RunnableScheduledFuture<V> task) {
	'''       return new CustomTask<V>(r, task);
	'''   }
	''' 
	'''   protected <V> RunnableScheduledFuture<V> decorateTask(
	'''                Callable<V> c, RunnableScheduledFuture<V> task) {
	'''       return new CustomTask<V>(c, task);
	'''   }

	Public Class ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor
		Inherits ThreadPoolExecutor
		Implements ScheduledExecutorService

	'    
	'     * This class specializes ThreadPoolExecutor implementation by
	'     *
	'     * 1. Using a custom task type, ScheduledFutureTask for
	'     *    tasks, even those that don't require scheduling (i.e.,
	'     *    those submitted using ExecutorService execute, not
	'     *    ScheduledExecutorService methods) which are treated as
	'     *    delayed tasks with a delay of zero.
	'     *
	'     * 2. Using a custom queue (DelayedWorkQueue), a variant of
	'     *    unbounded DelayQueue. The lack of capacity constraint and
	'     *    the fact that corePoolSize and maximumPoolSize are
	'     *    effectively identical simplifies some execution mechanics
	'     *    (see delayedExecute) compared to ThreadPoolExecutor.
	'     *
	'     * 3. Supporting optional run-after-shutdown parameters, which
	'     *    leads to overrides of shutdown methods to remove and cancel
	'     *    tasks that should NOT be run after shutdown, as well as
	'     *    different recheck logic when task (re)submission overlaps
	'     *    with a shutdown.
	'     *
	'     * 4. Task decoration methods to allow interception and
	'     *    instrumentation, which are needed because subclasses cannot
	'     *    otherwise override submit methods to get this effect. These
	'     *    don't have any impact on pool control logic though.
	'

	'        
	'         * A DelayedWorkQueue is based on a heap-based data structure
	'         * like those in DelayQueue and PriorityQueue, except that
	'         * every ScheduledFutureTask also records its index into the
	'         * heap array. This eliminates the need to find a task upon
	'         * cancellation, greatly speeding up removal (down from O(n)
	'         * to O(log n)), and reducing garbage retention that would
	'         * otherwise occur by waiting for the element to rise to top
	'         * before clearing. But because the queue may also hold
	'         * RunnableScheduledFutures that are not ScheduledFutureTasks,
	'         * we are not guaranteed to have such indices available, in
	'         * which case we fall back to linear search. (We expect that
	'         * most tasks will not be decorated, and that the faster cases
	'         * will be much more common.)
	'         *
	'         * All heap operations must record index changes -- mainly
	'         * within siftUp and siftDown. Upon removal, a task's
	'         * heapIndex is set to -1. Note that ScheduledFutureTasks can
	'         * appear at most once in the queue (this need not be true for
	'         * other kinds of tasks or work queues), so are uniquely
	'         * identified by heapIndex.
