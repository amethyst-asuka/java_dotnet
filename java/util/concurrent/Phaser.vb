	''' <summary>
	''' A reusable synchronization barrier, similar in functionality to
	''' <seealso cref="java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier CyclicBarrier"/> and
	''' <seealso cref="java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch CountDownLatch"/>
	''' but supporting more flexible usage.
	''' 
	''' <p><b>Registration.</b> Unlike the case for other barriers, the
	''' number of parties <em>registered</em> to synchronize on a phaser
	''' may vary over time.  Tasks may be registered at any time (using
	''' methods <seealso cref="#register"/>, <seealso cref="#bulkRegister"/>, or forms of
	''' constructors establishing initial numbers of parties), and
	''' optionally deregistered upon any arrival (using {@link
	''' #arriveAndDeregister}).  As is the case with most basic
	''' synchronization constructs, registration and deregistration affect
	''' only internal counts; they do not establish any further internal
	''' bookkeeping, so tasks cannot query whether they are registered.
	''' (However, you can introduce such bookkeeping by subclassing this
	''' class.)
	''' 
	''' <p><b>Synchronization.</b> Like a {@code CyclicBarrier}, a {@code
	''' Phaser} may be repeatedly awaited.  Method {@link
	''' #arriveAndAwaitAdvance} has effect analogous to {@link
	''' java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier#await CyclicBarrier.await}. Each
	''' generation of a phaser has an associated phase number. The phase
	''' number starts at zero, and advances when all parties arrive at the
	''' phaser, wrapping around to zero after reaching {@code
	''' Integer.MAX_VALUE}. The use of phase numbers enables independent
	''' control of actions upon arrival at a phaser and upon awaiting
	''' others, via two kinds of methods that may be invoked by any
	''' registered party:
	''' 
	''' <ul>
	''' 
	'''   <li> <b>Arrival.</b> Methods <seealso cref="#arrive"/> and
	'''       <seealso cref="#arriveAndDeregister"/> record arrival.  These methods
	'''       do not block, but return an associated <em>arrival phase
	'''       number</em>; that is, the phase number of the phaser to which
	'''       the arrival applied. When the final party for a given phase
	'''       arrives, an optional action is performed and the phase
	'''       advances.  These actions are performed by the party
	'''       triggering a phase advance, and are arranged by overriding
	'''       method <seealso cref="#onAdvance(int, int)"/>, which also controls
	'''       termination. Overriding this method is similar to, but more
	'''       flexible than, providing a barrier action to a {@code
	'''       CyclicBarrier}.
	''' 
	'''   <li> <b>Waiting.</b> Method <seealso cref="#awaitAdvance"/> requires an
	'''       argument indicating an arrival phase number, and returns when
	'''       the phaser advances to (or is already at) a different phase.
	'''       Unlike similar constructions using {@code CyclicBarrier},
	'''       method {@code awaitAdvance} continues to wait even if the
	'''       waiting thread is interrupted. Interruptible and timeout
	'''       versions are also available, but exceptions encountered while
	'''       tasks wait interruptibly or with timeout do not change the
	'''       state of the phaser. If necessary, you can perform any
	'''       associated recovery within handlers of those exceptions,
	'''       often after invoking {@code forceTermination}.  Phasers may
	'''       also be used by tasks executing in a <seealso cref="ForkJoinPool"/>,
	'''       which will ensure sufficient parallelism to execute tasks
	'''       when others are blocked waiting for a phase to advance.
	''' 
	''' </ul>
	''' 
	''' <p><b>Termination.</b> A phaser may enter a <em>termination</em>
	''' state, that may be checked using method <seealso cref="#isTerminated"/>. Upon
	''' termination, all synchronization methods immediately return without
	''' waiting for advance, as indicated by a negative return value.
	''' Similarly, attempts to register upon termination have no effect.
	''' Termination is triggered when an invocation of {@code onAdvance}
	''' returns {@code true}. The default implementation returns {@code
	''' true} if a deregistration has caused the number of registered
	''' parties to become zero.  As illustrated below, when phasers control
	''' actions with a fixed number of iterations, it is often convenient
	''' to override this method to cause termination when the current phase
	''' number reaches a threshold. Method <seealso cref="#forceTermination"/> is
	''' also available to abruptly release waiting threads and allow them
	''' to terminate.
	''' 
	''' <p><b>Tiering.</b> Phasers may be <em>tiered</em> (i.e.,
	''' constructed in tree structures) to reduce contention. Phasers with
	''' large numbers of parties that would otherwise experience heavy
	''' synchronization contention costs may instead be set up so that
	''' groups of sub-phasers share a common parent.  This may greatly
	''' increase throughput even though it incurs greater per-operation
	''' overhead.
	''' 
	''' <p>In a tree of tiered phasers, registration and deregistration of
	''' child phasers with their parent are managed automatically.
	''' Whenever the number of registered parties of a child phaser becomes
	''' non-zero (as established in the <seealso cref="#Phaser(Phaser,int)"/>
	''' constructor, <seealso cref="#register"/>, or <seealso cref="#bulkRegister"/>), the
	''' child phaser is registered with its parent.  Whenever the number of
	''' registered parties becomes zero as the result of an invocation of
	''' <seealso cref="#arriveAndDeregister"/>, the child phaser is deregistered
	''' from its parent.
	''' 
	''' <p><b>Monitoring.</b> While synchronization methods may be invoked
	''' only by registered parties, the current state of a phaser may be
	''' monitored by any caller.  At any given moment there are {@link
	''' #getRegisteredParties} parties in total, of which {@link
	''' #getArrivedParties} have arrived at the current phase ({@link
	''' #getPhase}).  When the remaining (<seealso cref="#getUnarrivedParties"/>)
	''' parties arrive, the phase advances.  The values returned by these
	''' methods may reflect transient states and so are not in general
	''' useful for synchronization control.  Method <seealso cref="#toString"/>
	''' returns snapshots of these state queries in a form convenient for
	''' informal monitoring.
	''' 
	''' <p><b>Sample usages:</b>
	''' 
	''' <p>A {@code Phaser} may be used instead of a {@code CountDownLatch}
	''' to control a one-shot action serving a variable number of parties.
	''' The typical idiom is for the method setting this up to first
	''' register, then start the actions, then deregister, as in:
	''' 
	'''  <pre> {@code
	''' void runTasks(List<Runnable> tasks) {
	'''   final Phaser phaser = new Phaser(1); // "1" to register self
	'''   // create and start threads
	'''   for (final Runnable task : tasks) {
	'''     phaser.register();
	'''     new Thread() {
	'''       public void run() {
	'''         phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance(); // await all creation
	'''         task.run();
	'''       }
	'''     }.start();
	'''   }
	''' 
	'''   // allow threads to start and deregister self
	'''   phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
	''' }}</pre>
	''' 
	''' <p>One way to cause a set of threads to repeatedly perform actions
	''' for a given number of iterations is to override {@code onAdvance}:
	''' 
	'''  <pre> {@code
	''' void startTasks(List<Runnable> tasks, final int iterations) {
	'''   final Phaser phaser = new Phaser() {
	'''     protected boolean onAdvance(int phase, int registeredParties) {
	'''       return phase >= iterations || registeredParties == 0;
	'''     }
	'''   };
	'''   phaser.register();
	'''   for (final Runnable task : tasks) {
	'''     phaser.register();
	'''     new Thread() {
	'''       public void run() {
	'''         do {
	'''           task.run();
	'''           phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
	'''         } while (!phaser.isTerminated());
	'''       }
	'''     }.start();
	'''   }
	'''   phaser.arriveAndDeregister(); // deregister self, don't wait
	''' }}</pre>
	''' 
	''' If the main task must later await termination, it
	''' may re-register and then execute a similar loop:
	'''  <pre> {@code
	'''   // ...
	'''   phaser.register();
	'''   while (!phaser.isTerminated())
	'''     phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();}</pre>
	''' 
	''' <p>Related constructions may be used to await particular phase numbers
	''' in contexts where you are sure that the phase will never wrap around
	''' {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE}. For example:
	''' 
	'''  <pre> {@code
	''' void awaitPhase(Phaser phaser, int phase) {
	'''   int p = phaser.register(); // assumes caller not already registered
	'''   while (p < phase) {
	'''     if (phaser.isTerminated())
	'''       // ... deal with unexpected termination
	'''     else
	'''       p = phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
	'''   }
	'''   phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
	''' }}</pre>
	''' 
	''' 
	''' <p>To create a set of {@code n} tasks using a tree of phasers, you
	''' could use code of the following form, assuming a Task class with a
	''' constructor accepting a {@code Phaser} that it registers with upon
	''' construction. After invocation of {@code build(new Task[n], 0, n,
	''' new Phaser())}, these tasks could then be started, for example by
	''' submitting to a pool:
	''' 
	'''  <pre> {@code
	''' void build(Task[] tasks, int lo, int hi, Phaser ph) {
	'''   if (hi - lo > TASKS_PER_PHASER) {
	'''     for (int i = lo; i < hi; i += TASKS_PER_PHASER) {
	'''       int j = Math.min(i + TASKS_PER_PHASER, hi);
	'''       build(tasks, i, j, new Phaser(ph));
	'''     }
	'''   } else {
	'''     for (int i = lo; i < hi; ++i)
	'''       tasks[i] = new Task(ph);
	'''       // assumes new Task(ph) performs ph.register()
	'''   }
	''' }}</pre>
	''' 
	''' The best value of {@code TASKS_PER_PHASER} depends mainly on
	''' expected synchronization rates. A value as low as four may
	''' be appropriate for extremely small per-phase task bodies (thus
	''' high rates), or up to hundreds for extremely large ones.
	''' 
	''' <p><b>Implementation notes</b>: This implementation restricts the
	''' maximum number of parties to 65535. Attempts to register additional
	''' parties result in {@code IllegalStateException}. However, you can and
	''' should create tiered phasers to accommodate arbitrarily large sets
	''' of participants.

		''' <summary>
		''' Primary state representation, holding four bit-fields:
		''' 
		''' unarrived  -- the number of parties yet to hit barrier (bits  0-15)
		''' parties    -- the number of parties to wait            (bits 16-31)
		''' phase      -- the generation of the barrier            (bits 32-62)
		''' terminated -- set if barrier is terminated             (bit  63 / sign)
		''' 
		''' Except that a phaser with no registered parties is
		''' distinguished by the otherwise illegal state of having zero
		''' parties and one unarrived parties (encoded as EMPTY below).
		''' 
		''' To efficiently maintain atomicity, these values are packed into
		''' a single (atomic) long. Good performance relies on keeping
		''' state decoding and encoding simple, and keeping race windows
		''' short.
		''' 
		''' All state updates are performed via CAS except initial
		''' registration of a sub-phaser (i.e., one with a non-null
		''' parent).  In this (relatively rare) case, we use built-in
		''' synchronization to lock while first registering with its
		''' parent.
