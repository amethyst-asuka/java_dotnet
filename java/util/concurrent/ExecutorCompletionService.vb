	''' <summary>
	''' A <seealso cref="CompletionService"/> that uses a supplied <seealso cref="Executor"/>
	''' to execute tasks.  This class arranges that submitted tasks are,
	''' upon completion, placed on a queue accessible using {@code take}.
	''' The class is lightweight enough to be suitable for transient use
	''' when processing groups of tasks.
	''' 
	''' <p>
	''' 
	''' <b>Usage Examples.</b>
	''' 
	''' Suppose you have a set of solvers for a certain problem, each
	''' returning a value of some type {@code Result}, and would like to
	''' run them concurrently, processing the results of each of them that
	''' return a non-null value, in some method {@code use(Result r)}. You
	''' could write this as:
	''' 
	''' <pre> {@code
	'''  Sub  solve(Executor e,
	'''            Collection<Callable<Result>> solvers)
	'''     throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
	'''     CompletionService<Result> ecs
	'''         = new ExecutorCompletionService<Result>(e);
	'''     for (Callable<Result> s : solvers)
	'''         ecs.submit(s);
	'''     int n = solvers.size();
	'''     for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
	'''         Result r = ecs.take().get();
	'''         if (r != null)
	'''             use(r);
	'''     }
	''' }}</pre>
	''' 
	''' Suppose instead that you would like to use the first non-null result
	''' of the set of tasks, ignoring any that encounter exceptions,
	''' and cancelling all other tasks when the first one is ready:
	''' 
	''' <pre> {@code
	'''  Sub  solve(Executor e,
	'''            Collection<Callable<Result>> solvers)
	'''     throws InterruptedException {
	'''     CompletionService<Result> ecs
	'''         = new ExecutorCompletionService<Result>(e);
	'''     int n = solvers.size();
	'''     List<Future<Result>> futures
	'''         = new ArrayList<Future<Result>>(n);
	'''     Result result = null;
	'''     try {
	'''         for (Callable<Result> s : solvers)
	'''             futures.add(ecs.submit(s));
	'''         for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
	'''             try {
	'''                 Result r = ecs.take().get();
	'''                 if (r != null) {
	'''                     result = r;
	'''                     break;
	'''                 }
	'''             } catch (ExecutionException ignore) {}
	'''         }
	'''     }
	'''     finally {
	'''         for (Future<Result> f : futures)
	'''             f.cancel(true);
	'''     }
	''' 
	'''     if (result != null)
	'''         use(result);
	''' }}</pre>
