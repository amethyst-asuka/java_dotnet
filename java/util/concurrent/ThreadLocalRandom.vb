	''' <summary>
	''' A random number generator isolated to the current thread.  Like the
	''' global <seealso cref="java.util.Random"/> generator used by the {@link
	''' java.lang.Math} [Class], a {@code ThreadLocalRandom} is initialized
	''' with an internally generated seed that may not otherwise be
	''' modified. When applicable, use of {@code ThreadLocalRandom} rather
	''' than shared {@code Random} objects in concurrent programs will
	''' typically encounter much less overhead and contention.  Use of
	''' {@code ThreadLocalRandom} is particularly appropriate when multiple
	''' tasks (for example, each a <seealso cref="ForkJoinTask"/>) use random numbers
	''' in parallel in thread pools.
	''' 
	''' <p>Usages of this class should typically be of the form:
	''' {@code ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextX(...)} (where
	''' {@code X} is {@code Int}, {@code Long}, etc).
	''' When all usages are of this form, it is never possible to
	''' accidently share a {@code ThreadLocalRandom} across multiple threads.
	''' 
	''' <p>This class also provides additional commonly used bounded random
	''' generation methods.
	''' 
	''' <p>Instances of {@code ThreadLocalRandom} are not cryptographically
	''' secure.  Consider instead using <seealso cref="java.security.SecureRandom"/>
	''' in security-sensitive applications. Additionally,
	''' default-constructed instances do not use a cryptographically random
	''' seed unless the <seealso cref="System#getProperty system property"/>
	''' {@code java.util.secureRandomSeed} is set to {@code true}.

	Public Class ThreadLocalRandom
		Inherits Random

	'    
	'     * This class implements the java.util.Random API (and subclasses
	'     * Random) using a single static instance that accesses random
	'     * number state held in class Thread (primarily, field
	'     * threadLocalRandomSeed). In doing so, it also provides a home
	'     * for managing package-private utilities that rely on exactly the
	'     * same state as needed to maintain the ThreadLocalRandom
	'     * instances. We leverage the need for an initialization flag
	'     * field to also use it as a "probe" -- a self-adjusting thread
	'     * hash used for contention avoidance, as well as a secondary
	'     * simpler (xorShift) random seed that is conservatively used to
	'     * avoid otherwise surprising users by hijacking the
	'     * ThreadLocalRandom sequence.  The dual use is a marriage of
	'     * convenience, but is a simple and efficient way of reducing
	'     * application-level overhead and footprint of most concurrent
	'     * programs.
	'     *
	'     * Even though this class subclasses java.util.Random, it uses the
	'     * same basic algorithm as java.util.SplittableRandom.  (See its
	'     * internal documentation for explanations, which are not repeated
	'     * here.)  Because ThreadLocalRandoms are not splittable
	'     * though, we use only a single 64bit gamma.
	'     *
	'     * Because this class is in a different package than class Thread,
	'     * field access methods use Unsafe to bypass access control rules.
	'     * To conform to the requirements of the Random superclass
	'     * constructor, the common static ThreadLocalRandom maintains an
	'     * "initialized" field for the sake of rejecting user calls to
	'     * setSeed while still allowing a call from constructor.  Note
	'     * that serialization is completely unnecessary because there is
	'     * only a static singleton.  But we generate a serial form
	'     * containing "rnd" and "initialized" fields to ensure
	'     * compatibility across versions.
	'     *
	'     * Implementations of non-core methods are mostly the same as in
	'     * SplittableRandom, that were in part derived from a previous
	'     * version of this class.
	'     *
	'     * The nextLocalGaussian ThreadLocal supports the very rarely used
	'     * nextGaussian method by providing a holder for the second of a
	'     * pair of them. As is true for the base class version of this
	'     * method, this time/space tradeoff is probably never worthwhile,
	'     * but we provide identical statistical properties.

		' Within-package utilities

	'     * Descriptions of the usages of the methods below can be found in
	'     * the classes that use them. Briefly, a thread's "probe" value is
	'     * a non-zero hash code that (probably) does not collide with
	'     * other existing threads with respect to any power of two
	'     * collision space. When it does collide, it is pseudo-randomly
	'     * adjusted (using a Marsaglia XorShift). The nextSecondarySeed
	'     * method is used in the same contexts as ThreadLocalRandom, but
	'     * only for transient usages such as random adaptive spin/block
	'     * sequences for which a cheap RNG suffices and for which it could
	'     * in principle disrupt user-visible statistical properties of the
	'     * main ThreadLocalRandom if we were to use it.
	'     *
	'     * Note: Because of package-protection issues, versions of some
	'     * these methods also appear in some subpackage classes.
