	''' <summary>
	''' A <seealso cref="ForkJoinTask"/> with a completion action performed when
	''' triggered and there are no remaining pending actions.
	''' CountedCompleters are in general more robust in the
	''' presence of subtask stalls and blockage than are other forms of
	''' ForkJoinTasks, but are less intuitive to program.  Uses of
	''' CountedCompleter are similar to those of other completion based
	''' components (such as <seealso cref="java.nio.channels.CompletionHandler"/>)
	''' except that multiple <em>pending</em> completions may be necessary
	''' to trigger the completion action <seealso cref="#onCompletion(CountedCompleter)"/>,
	''' not just one.
	''' Unless initialized otherwise, the {@link #getPendingCount pending
	''' count} starts at zero, but may be (atomically) changed using
	''' methods <seealso cref="#setPendingCount"/>, <seealso cref="#addToPendingCount"/>, and
	''' <seealso cref="#compareAndSetPendingCount"/>. Upon invocation of {@link
	''' #tryComplete}, if the pending action count is nonzero, it is
	''' decremented; otherwise, the completion action is performed, and if
	''' this completer itself has a completer, the process is continued
	''' with its completer.  As is the case with related synchronization
	''' components such as <seealso cref="java.util.concurrent.Phaser Phaser"/> and
	''' <seealso cref="java.util.concurrent.Semaphore Semaphore"/>, these methods
	''' affect only internal counts; they do not establish any further
	''' internal bookkeeping. In particular, the identities of pending
	''' tasks are not maintained. As illustrated below, you can create
	''' subclasses that do record some or all pending tasks or their
	''' results when needed.  As illustrated below, utility methods
	''' supporting customization of completion traversals are also
	''' provided. However, because CountedCompleters provide only basic
	''' synchronization mechanisms, it may be useful to create further
	''' abstract subclasses that maintain linkages, fields, and additional
	''' support methods appropriate for a set of related usages.
	''' 
	''' <p>A concrete CountedCompleter class must define method {@link
	''' #compute}, that should in most cases (as illustrated below), invoke
	''' {@code tryComplete()} once before returning. The class may also
	''' optionally override method <seealso cref="#onCompletion(CountedCompleter)"/>
	''' to perform an action upon normal completion, and method
	''' <seealso cref="#onExceptionalCompletion(Throwable, CountedCompleter)"/> to
	''' perform an action upon any exception.
	''' 
	''' <p>CountedCompleters most often do not bear results, in which case
	''' they are normally declared as {@code CountedCompleter<Void>}, and
	''' will always return {@code null} as a result value.  In other cases,
	''' you should override method <seealso cref="#getRawResult"/> to provide a
	''' result from {@code join(), invoke()}, and related methods.  In
	''' general, this method should return the value of a field (or a
	''' function of one or more fields) of the CountedCompleter object that
	''' holds the result upon completion. Method <seealso cref="#setRawResult"/> by
	''' default plays no role in CountedCompleters.  It is possible, but
	''' rarely applicable, to override this method to maintain other
	''' objects or fields holding result data.
	''' 
	''' <p>A CountedCompleter that does not itself have a completer (i.e.,
	''' one for which <seealso cref="#getCompleter"/> returns {@code null}) can be
	''' used as a regular ForkJoinTask with this added functionality.
	''' However, any completer that in turn has another completer serves
	''' only as an internal helper for other computations, so its own task
	''' status (as reported in methods such as <seealso cref="ForkJoinTask#isDone"/>)
	''' is arbitrary; this status changes only upon explicit invocations of
	''' <seealso cref="#complete"/>, <seealso cref="ForkJoinTask#cancel"/>,
	''' <seealso cref="ForkJoinTask#completeExceptionally(Throwable)"/> or upon
	''' exceptional completion of method {@code compute}. Upon any
	''' exceptional completion, the exception may be relayed to a task's
	''' completer (and its completer, and so on), if one exists and it has
	''' not otherwise already completed. Similarly, cancelling an internal
	''' CountedCompleter has only a local effect on that completer, so is
	''' not often useful.
	''' 
	''' <p><b>Sample Usages.</b>
	''' 
	''' <p><b>Parallel recursive decomposition.</b> CountedCompleters may
	''' be arranged in trees similar to those often used with {@link
	''' RecursiveAction}s, although the constructions involved in setting
	''' them up typically vary. Here, the completer of each task is its
	''' parent in the computation tree. Even though they entail a bit more
	''' bookkeeping, CountedCompleters may be better choices when applying
	''' a possibly time-consuming operation (that cannot be further
	''' subdivided) to each element of an array or collection; especially
	''' when the operation takes a significantly different amount of time
	''' to complete for some elements than others, either because of
	''' intrinsic variation (for example I/O) or auxiliary effects such as
	''' garbage collection.  Because CountedCompleters provide their own
	''' continuations, other threads need not block waiting to perform
	''' them.
	''' 
	''' <p>For example, here is an initial version of a class that uses
	''' divide-by-two recursive decomposition to divide work into single
	''' pieces (leaf tasks). Even when work is split into individual calls,
	''' tree-based techniques are usually preferable to directly forking
	''' leaf tasks, because they reduce inter-thread communication and
	''' improve load balancing. In the recursive case, the second of each
	''' pair of subtasks to finish triggers completion of its parent
	''' (because no result combination is performed, the default no-op
	''' implementation of method {@code onCompletion} is not overridden).
	''' A static utility method sets up the base task and invokes it
	''' (here, implicitly using the <seealso cref="ForkJoinPool#commonPool()"/>).
	''' 
	''' <pre> {@code
	''' class MyOperation<E> {  Sub  apply(E e) { ... }  }
	''' 
	''' class ForEach<E> extends CountedCompleter<Void> {
	''' 
	'''   public static <E>  Sub  forEach(E[] array, MyOperation<E> op) {
	'''     new ForEach<E>(null, array, op, 0, array.length).invoke();
	'''   }
	''' 
	'''   final E[] array; final MyOperation<E> op; final int lo, hi;
	'''   ForEach(CountedCompleter<?> p, E[] array, MyOperation<E> op, int lo, int hi) {
	'''     super(p);
	'''     this.array = array; this.op = op; this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi;
	'''   }
	''' 
	'''   public  Sub  compute() { // version 1
	'''     if (hi - lo >= 2) {
	'''       int mid = (lo + hi) >>> 1;
	'''       setPendingCount(2); // must set pending count before fork
	'''       new ForEach(this, array, op, mid, hi).fork(); // right child
	'''       new ForEach(this, array, op, lo, mid).fork(); // left child
	'''     }
	'''     else if (hi > lo)
	'''       op.apply(array[lo]);
	'''     tryComplete();
	'''   }
	''' }}</pre>
	''' 
	''' This design can be improved by noticing that in the recursive case,
	''' the task has nothing to do after forking its right task, so can
	''' directly invoke its left task before returning. (This is an analog
	''' of tail recursion removal.)  Also, because the task returns upon
	''' executing its left task (rather than falling through to invoke
	''' {@code tryComplete}) the pending count is set to one:
	''' 
	''' <pre> {@code
	''' class ForEach<E> ...
	'''   public  Sub  compute() { // version 2
	'''     if (hi - lo >= 2) {
	'''       int mid = (lo + hi) >>> 1;
	'''       setPendingCount(1); // only one pending
	'''       new ForEach(this, array, op, mid, hi).fork(); // right child
	'''       new ForEach(this, array, op, lo, mid).compute(); // direct invoke
	'''     }
	'''     else {
	'''       if (hi > lo)
	'''         op.apply(array[lo]);
	'''       tryComplete();
	'''     }
	'''   }
	''' }</pre>
	''' 
	''' As a further improvement, notice that the left task need not even exist.
	''' Instead of creating a new one, we can iterate using the original task,
	''' and add a pending count for each fork.  Additionally, because no task
	''' in this tree implements an <seealso cref="#onCompletion(CountedCompleter)"/> method,
	''' {@code tryComplete()} can be replaced with <seealso cref="#propagateCompletion"/>.
	''' 
	''' <pre> {@code
	''' class ForEach<E> ...
	'''   public  Sub  compute() { // version 3
	'''     int l = lo,  h = hi;
	'''     while (h - l >= 2) {
	'''       int mid = (l + h) >>> 1;
	'''       addToPendingCount(1);
	'''       new ForEach(this, array, op, mid, h).fork(); // right child
	'''       h = mid;
	'''     }
	'''     if (h > l)
	'''       op.apply(array[l]);
	'''     propagateCompletion();
	'''   }
	''' }</pre>
	''' 
	''' Additional improvements of such classes might entail precomputing
	''' pending counts so that they can be established in constructors,
	''' specializing classes for leaf steps, subdividing by say, four,
	''' instead of two per iteration, and using an adaptive threshold
	''' instead of always subdividing down to single elements.
	''' 
	''' <p><b>Searching.</b> A tree of CountedCompleters can search for a
	''' value or property in different parts of a data structure, and
	''' report a result in an {@link
	''' java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference AtomicReference} as
	''' soon as one is found. The others can poll the result to avoid
	''' unnecessary work. (You could additionally {@link #cancel
	''' cancel} other tasks, but it is usually simpler and more efficient
	''' to just let them notice that the result is set and if so skip
	''' further processing.)  Illustrating again with an array using full
	''' partitioning (again, in practice, leaf tasks will almost always
	''' process more than one element):
	''' 
	''' <pre> {@code
	''' class Searcher<E> extends CountedCompleter<E> {
	'''   final E[] array; final AtomicReference<E> result; final int lo, hi;
	'''   Searcher(CountedCompleter<?> p, E[] array, AtomicReference<E> result, int lo, int hi) {
	'''     super(p);
	'''     this.array = array; this.result = result; this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi;
	'''   }
	'''   public E getRawResult() { return result.get(); }
	'''   public  Sub  compute() { // similar to ForEach version 3
	'''     int l = lo,  h = hi;
	'''     while (result.get() == null && h >= l) {
	'''       if (h - l >= 2) {
	'''         int mid = (l + h) >>> 1;
	'''         addToPendingCount(1);
	'''         new Searcher(this, array, result, mid, h).fork();
	'''         h = mid;
	'''       }
	'''       else {
	'''         E x = array[l];
	'''         if (matches(x) && result.compareAndSet(null, x))
	'''           quietlyCompleteRoot(); // root task is now joinable
	'''         break;
	'''       }
	'''     }
	'''     tryComplete(); // normally complete whether or not found
	'''   }
	'''   boolean matches(E e) { ... } // return true if found
	''' 
	'''   public static <E> E search(E[] array) {
	'''       return new Searcher<E>(null, array, new AtomicReference<E>(), 0, array.length).invoke();
	'''   }
	''' }}</pre>
	''' 
	''' In this example, as well as others in which tasks have no other
	''' effects except to compareAndSet a common result, the trailing
	''' unconditional invocation of {@code tryComplete} could be made
	''' conditional ({@code if (result.get() == null) tryComplete();})
	''' because no further bookkeeping is required to manage completions
	''' once the root task completes.
	''' 
	''' <p><b>Recording subtasks.</b> CountedCompleter tasks that combine
	''' results of multiple subtasks usually need to access these results
	''' in method <seealso cref="#onCompletion(CountedCompleter)"/>. As illustrated in the following
	''' class (that performs a simplified form of map-reduce where mappings
	''' and reductions are all of type {@code E}), one way to do this in
	''' divide and conquer designs is to have each subtask record its
	''' sibling, so that it can be accessed in method {@code onCompletion}.
	''' This technique applies to reductions in which the order of
	''' combining left and right results does not matter; ordered
	''' reductions require explicit left/right designations.  Variants of
	''' other streamlinings seen in the above examples may also apply.
	''' 
	''' <pre> {@code
	''' class MyMapper<E> { E apply(E v) {  ...  } }
	''' class MyReducer<E> { E apply(E x, E y) {  ...  } }
	''' class MapReducer<E> extends CountedCompleter<E> {
	'''   final E[] array; final MyMapper<E> mapper;
	'''   final MyReducer<E> reducer; final int lo, hi;
	'''   MapReducer<E> sibling;
	'''   E result;
	'''   MapReducer(CountedCompleter<?> p, E[] array, MyMapper<E> mapper,
	'''              MyReducer<E> reducer, int lo, int hi) {
	'''     super(p);
	'''     this.array = array; this.mapper = mapper;
	'''     this.reducer = reducer; this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi;
	'''   }
	'''   public  Sub  compute() {
	'''     if (hi - lo >= 2) {
	'''       int mid = (lo + hi) >>> 1;
	'''       MapReducer<E> left = new MapReducer(this, array, mapper, reducer, lo, mid);
	'''       MapReducer<E> right = new MapReducer(this, array, mapper, reducer, mid, hi);
	'''       left.sibling = right;
	'''       right.sibling = left;
	'''       setPendingCount(1); // only right is pending
	'''       right.fork();
	'''       left.compute();     // directly execute left
	'''     }
	'''     else {
	'''       if (hi > lo)
	'''           result = mapper.apply(array[lo]);
	'''       tryComplete();
	'''     }
	'''   }
	'''   public  Sub  onCompletion(CountedCompleter<?> caller) {
	'''     if (caller != this) {
	'''       MapReducer<E> child = (MapReducer<E>)caller;
	'''       MapReducer<E> sib = child.sibling;
	'''       if (sib == null || sib.result == null)
	'''         result = child.result;
	'''       else
	'''         result = reducer.apply(child.result, sib.result);
	'''     }
	'''   }
	'''   public E getRawResult() { return result; }
	''' 
	'''   public static <E> E mapReduce(E[] array, MyMapper<E> mapper, MyReducer<E> reducer) {
	'''     return new MapReducer<E>(null, array, mapper, reducer,
	'''                              0, array.length).invoke();
	'''   }
	''' }}</pre>
	''' 
	''' Here, method {@code onCompletion} takes a form common to many
	''' completion designs that combine results. This callback-style method
	''' is triggered once per task, in either of the two different contexts
	''' in which the pending count is, or becomes, zero: (1) by a task
	''' itself, if its pending count is zero upon invocation of {@code
	''' tryComplete}, or (2) by any of its subtasks when they complete and
	''' decrement the pending count to zero. The {@code caller} argument
	''' distinguishes cases.  Most often, when the caller is {@code this},
	''' no action is necessary. Otherwise the caller argument can be used
	''' (usually via a cast) to supply a value (and/or links to other
	''' values) to be combined.  Assuming proper use of pending counts, the
	''' actions inside {@code onCompletion} occur (once) upon completion of
	''' a task and its subtasks. No additional synchronization is required
	''' within this method to ensure thread safety of accesses to fields of
	''' this task or other completed tasks.
	''' 
	''' <p><b>Completion Traversals</b>. If using {@code onCompletion} to
	''' process completions is inapplicable or inconvenient, you can use
	''' methods <seealso cref="#firstComplete"/> and <seealso cref="#nextComplete"/> to create
	''' custom traversals.  For example, to define a MapReducer that only
	''' splits out right-hand tasks in the form of the third ForEach
	''' example, the completions must cooperatively reduce along
	''' unexhausted subtask links, which can be done as follows:
	''' 
	''' <pre> {@code
	''' class MapReducer<E> extends CountedCompleter<E> { // version 2
	'''   final E[] array; final MyMapper<E> mapper;
	'''   final MyReducer<E> reducer; final int lo, hi;
	'''   MapReducer<E> forks, next; // record subtask forks in list
	'''   E result;
	'''   MapReducer(CountedCompleter<?> p, E[] array, MyMapper<E> mapper,
	'''              MyReducer<E> reducer, int lo, int hi, MapReducer<E> next) {
	'''     super(p);
	'''     this.array = array; this.mapper = mapper;
	'''     this.reducer = reducer; this.lo = lo; this.hi = hi;
	'''     this.next = next;
	'''   }
	'''   public  Sub  compute() {
	'''     int l = lo,  h = hi;
	'''     while (h - l >= 2) {
	'''       int mid = (l + h) >>> 1;
	'''       addToPendingCount(1);
	'''       (forks = new MapReducer(this, array, mapper, reducer, mid, h, forks)).fork();
	'''       h = mid;
	'''     }
	'''     if (h > l)
	'''       result = mapper.apply(array[l]);
	'''     // process completions by reducing along and advancing subtask links
	'''     for (CountedCompleter<?> c = firstComplete(); c != null; c = c.nextComplete()) {
	'''       for (MapReducer t = (MapReducer)c, s = t.forks;  s != null; s = t.forks = s.next)
	'''         t.result = reducer.apply(t.result, s.result);
	'''     }
	'''   }
	'''   public E getRawResult() { return result; }
	''' 
	'''   public static <E> E mapReduce(E[] array, MyMapper<E> mapper, MyReducer<E> reducer) {
	'''     return new MapReducer<E>(null, array, mapper, reducer,
	'''                              0, array.length, null).invoke();
	'''   }
	''' }}</pre>
	''' 
	''' <p><b>Triggers.</b> Some CountedCompleters are themselves never
	''' forked, but instead serve as bits of plumbing in other designs;
	''' including those in which the completion of one or more async tasks
	''' triggers another async task. For example:
	''' 
	''' <pre> {@code
	''' class HeaderBuilder extends CountedCompleter<...> { ... }
	''' class BodyBuilder extends CountedCompleter<...> { ... }
	''' class PacketSender extends CountedCompleter<...> {
	'''   PacketSender(...) { super(null, 1); ... } // trigger on second completion
	'''   public  Sub  compute() { } // never called
	'''   public  Sub  onCompletion(CountedCompleter<?> caller) { sendPacket(); }
	''' }
	''' // sample use:
	''' PacketSender p = new PacketSender();
	''' new HeaderBuilder(p, ...).fork();
	''' new BodyBuilder(p, ...).fork();
	''' }</pre>
