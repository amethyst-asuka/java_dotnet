	''' <summary>
	''' An optionally-bounded <seealso cref="BlockingDeque blocking deque"/> based on
	''' linked nodes.
	''' 
	''' <p>The optional capacity bound constructor argument serves as a
	''' way to prevent excessive expansion. The capacity, if unspecified,
	''' is equal to <seealso cref="Integer#MAX_VALUE"/>.  Linked nodes are
	''' dynamically created upon each insertion unless this would bring the
	''' deque above capacity.
	''' 
	''' <p>Most operations run in constant time (ignoring time spent
	''' blocking).  Exceptions include <seealso cref="#remove(Object) remove"/>,
	''' <seealso cref="#removeFirstOccurrence removeFirstOccurrence"/>, {@link
	''' #removeLastOccurrence removeLastOccurrence}, {@link #contains
	''' contains}, <seealso cref="#iterator iterator.remove()"/>, and the bulk
	''' operations, all of which run in linear time.
	''' 
	''' <p>This class and its iterator implement all of the
	''' <em>optional</em> methods of the <seealso cref="Collection"/> and {@link
	''' Iterator} interfaces.
	''' 
	''' <p>This class is a member of the

	Public Class LinkedBlockingDeque(Of E)
		Inherits java.util.AbstractQueue(Of E)
		Implements BlockingDeque(Of E)

	'    
	'     * Implemented as a simple doubly-linked list protected by a
	'     * single lock and using conditions to manage blocking.
	'     *
	'     * To implement weakly consistent iterators, it appears we need to
	'     * keep all Nodes GC-reachable from a predecessor dequeued Node.
	'     * That would cause two problems:
	'     * - allow a rogue Iterator to cause unbounded memory retention
	'     * - cause cross-generational linking of old Nodes to new Nodes if
	'     *   a Node was tenured while live, which generational GCs have a
	'     *   hard time dealing with, causing repeated major collections.
	'     * However, only non-deleted Nodes need to be reachable from
	'     * dequeued Nodes, and reachability does not necessarily have to
	'     * be of the kind understood by the GC.  We use the trick of
	'     * linking a Node that has just been dequeued to itself.  Such a
	'     * self-link implicitly means to jump to "first" (for next links)
	'     * or "last" (for prev links).
	'     

	'    
	'     * We have "diamond" multiple interface/abstract class inheritance
	'     * here, and that introduces ambiguities. Often we want the
	'     * BlockingDeque javadoc combined with the AbstractQueue
	'     * implementation, so a lot of method specs are duplicated here.
