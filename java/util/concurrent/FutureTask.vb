	''' <summary>
	''' A cancellable asynchronous computation.  This class provides a base
	''' implementation of <seealso cref="Future"/>, with methods to start and cancel
	''' a computation, query to see if the computation is complete, and
	''' retrieve the result of the computation.  The result can only be
	''' retrieved when the computation has completed; the {@code get}
	''' methods will block if the computation has not yet completed.  Once
	''' the computation has completed, the computation cannot be restarted
	''' or cancelled (unless the computation is invoked using
	''' <seealso cref="#runAndReset"/>).
	''' 
	''' <p>A {@code FutureTask} can be used to wrap a <seealso cref="Callable"/> or
	''' <seealso cref="Runnable"/> object.  Because {@code FutureTask} implements
	''' {@code Runnable}, a {@code FutureTask} can be submitted to an
	''' <seealso cref="Executor"/> for execution.
	''' 
	''' <p>In addition to serving as a standalone class, this class provides
	''' {@code protected} functionality that may be useful when creating
	''' customized task classes.
	''' 
	''' @since 1.5
	''' @author Doug Lea </summary>
	''' @param <V> The result type returned by this FutureTask's {@code get} methods </param>
	Public Class FutureTask(Of V)
		Implements RunnableFuture(Of V)

	'    
	'     * Revision notes: This differs from previous versions of this
	'     * class that relied on AbstractQueuedSynchronizer, mainly to
	'     * avoid surprising users about retaining interrupt status during
	'     * cancellation races. Sync control in the current design relies
	'     * on a "state" field updated via CAS to track completion, along
	'     * with a simple Treiber stack to hold waiting threads.
	'     *
	'     * Style note: As usual, we bypass overhead of using
	'     * AtomicXFieldUpdaters and instead directly use Unsafe intrinsics.
