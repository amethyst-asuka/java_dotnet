	Public Class CompletableFuture(Of T)
		Implements java.util.concurrent.Future(Of T), java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage(Of T)

	'    
	'     * Overview:
	'     *
	'     * A CompletableFuture may have dependent completion actions,
	'     * collected in a linked stack. It atomically completes by CASing
	'     * a result field, and then pops off and runs those actions. This
	'     * applies across normal vs exceptional outcomes, sync vs async
	'     * actions, binary triggers, and various forms of completions.
	'     *
	'     * Non-nullness of field result (set via CAS) indicates done.  An
	'     * AltResult is used to box null as a result, as well as to hold
	'     * exceptions.  Using a single field makes completion simple to
	'     * detect and trigger.  Encoding and decoding is straightforward
	'     * but adds to the sprawl of trapping and associating exceptions
	'     * with targets.  Minor simplifications rely on (static) NIL (to
	'     * box null results) being the only AltResult with a null
	'     * exception field, so we don't usually need explicit comparisons.
	'     * Even though some of the generics casts are unchecked (see
	'     * SuppressWarnings annotations), they are placed to be
	'     * appropriate even if checked.
	'     *
	'     * Dependent actions are represented by Completion objects linked
	'     * as Treiber stacks headed by field "stack". There are Completion
	'     * classes for each kind of action, grouped into single-input
	'     * (UniCompletion), two-input (BiCompletion), projected
	'     * (BiCompletions using either (not both) of two inputs), shared
	'     * (CoCompletion, used by the second of two sources), zero-input
	'     * source actions, and Signallers that unblock waiters. Class
	'     * Completion extends ForkJoinTask to enable async execution
	'     * (adding no space overhead because we exploit its "tag" methods
	'     * to maintain claims). It is also declared as Runnable to allow
	'     * usage with arbitrary executors.
	'     *
	'     * Support for each kind of CompletionStage relies on a separate
	'     * class, along with two CompletableFuture methods:
	'     *
	'     * * A Completion class with name X corresponding to function,
	'     *   prefaced with "Uni", "Bi", or "Or". Each class contains
	'     *   fields for source(s), actions, and dependent. They are
	'     *   boringly similar, differing from others only with respect to
	'     *   underlying functional forms. We do this so that users don't
	'     *   encounter layers of adaptors in common usages. We also
	'     *   include "Relay" classes/methods that don't correspond to user
	'     *   methods; they copy results from one stage to another.
	'     *
	'     * * Boolean CompletableFuture method x(...) (for example
	'     *   uniApply) takes all of the arguments needed to check that an
	'     *   action is triggerable, and then either runs the action or
	'     *   arranges its async execution by executing its Completion
	'     *   argument, if present. The method returns true if known to be
	'     *   complete.
	'     *
	'     * * Completion method tryFire(int mode) invokes the associated x
	'     *   method with its held arguments, and on success cleans up.
	'     *   The mode argument allows tryFire to be called twice (SYNC,
	'     *   then ASYNC); the first to screen and trap exceptions while
	'     *   arranging to execute, and the second when called from a
	'     *   task. (A few classes are not used async so take slightly
	'     *   different forms.)  The claim() callback suppresses function
	'     *   invocation if already claimed by another thread.
	'     *
	'     * * CompletableFuture method xStage(...) is called from a public
	'     *   stage method of CompletableFuture x. It screens user
	'     *   arguments and invokes and/or creates the stage object.  If
	'     *   not async and x is already complete, the action is run
	'     *   immediately.  Otherwise a Completion c is created, pushed to
	'     *   x's stack (unless done), and started or triggered via
	'     *   c.tryFire.  This also covers races possible if x completes
	'     *   while pushing.  Classes with two inputs (for example BiApply)
	'     *   deal with races across both while pushing actions.  The
	'     *   second completion is a CoCompletion pointing to the first,
	'     *   shared so that at most one performs the action.  The
	'     *   multiple-arity methods allOf and anyOf do this pairwise to
	'     *   form trees of completions.
	'     *
	'     * Note that the generic type parameters of methods vary according
	'     * to whether "this" is a source, dependent, or completion.
	'     *
	'     * Method postComplete is called upon completion unless the target
	'     * is guaranteed not to be observable (i.e., not yet returned or
	'     * linked). Multiple threads can call postComplete, which
	'     * atomically pops each dependent action, and tries to trigger it
	'     * via method tryFire, in NESTED mode.  Triggering can propagate
	'     * recursively, so NESTED mode returns its completed dependent (if
	'     * one exists) for further processing by its caller (see method
	'     * postFire).
	'     *
	'     * Blocking methods get() and join() rely on Signaller Completions
	'     * that wake up waiting threads.  The mechanics are similar to
	'     * Treiber stack wait-nodes used in FutureTask, Phaser, and
	'     * SynchronousQueue. See their internal documentation for
	'     * algorithmic details.
	'     *
	'     * Without precautions, CompletableFutures would be prone to
	'     * garbage accumulation as chains of Completions build up, each
	'     * pointing back to its sources. So we null out fields as soon as
	'     * possible (see especially method Completion.detach). The
	'     * screening checks needed anyway harmlessly ignore null arguments
	'     * that may have been obtained during races with threads nulling
	'     * out fields.  We also try to unlink fired Completions from
	'     * stacks that might never be popped (see method postFire).
	'     * Completion fields need not be declared as final or volatile
	'     * because they are only visible to other threads upon safe
	'     * publication.
