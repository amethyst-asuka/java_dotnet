	''' <summary>
	''' A bounded <seealso cref="BlockingQueue blocking queue"/> backed by an
	''' array.  This queue orders elements FIFO (first-in-first-out).  The
	''' <em>head</em> of the queue is that element that has been on the
	''' queue the longest time.  The <em>tail</em> of the queue is that
	''' element that has been on the queue the shortest time. New elements
	''' are inserted at the tail of the queue, and the queue retrieval
	''' operations obtain elements at the head of the queue.
	''' 
	''' <p>This is a classic &quot;bounded buffer&quot;, in which a
	''' fixed-sized array holds elements inserted by producers and
	''' extracted by consumers.  Once created, the capacity cannot be
	''' changed.  Attempts to {@code put} an element into a full queue
	''' will result in the operation blocking; attempts to {@code take} an
	''' element from an empty queue will similarly block.
	''' 
	''' <p>This class supports an optional fairness policy for ordering
	''' waiting producer and consumer threads.  By default, this ordering
	''' is not guaranteed. However, a queue constructed with fairness set
	''' to {@code true} grants threads access in FIFO order. Fairness
	''' generally decreases throughput but reduces variability and avoids
	''' starvation.
	''' 
	''' <p>This class and its iterator implement all of the
	''' <em>optional</em> methods of the <seealso cref="Collection"/> and {@link
	''' Iterator} interfaces.

	''' <p>This class is a member of the

		''' (1) keeping track of the number of "cycles", that is, the
		'''     number of times takeIndex has wrapped around to 0.
		''' (2) notifying all iterators via the callback removedAt whenever
		'''     an interior element is removed (and thus other elements may
		'''     be shifted).
		''' 
		''' These suffice to eliminate iterator inconsistencies, but
		''' unfortunately add the secondary responsibility of maintaining
		''' the list of iterators.  We track all active iterators in a
		''' simple linked list (accessed only when the queue's lock is
		''' held) of weak references to Itr.  The list is cleaned up using
		''' 3 different mechanisms:
		''' 
		''' (1) Whenever a new iterator is created, do some O(1) checking for
		'''     stale list elements.
		''' 
		''' (2) Whenever takeIndex wraps around to 0, check for iterators
		'''     that have been unused for more than one wrap-around cycle.
		''' 
		''' (3) Whenever the queue becomes empty, all iterators are notified
		'''     and this entire data structure is discarded.
		''' 
		''' So in addition to the removedAt callback that is necessary for
		''' correctness, iterators have the shutdown and takeIndexWrapped
		''' callbacks that help remove stale iterators from the list.
		''' 
		''' Whenever a list element is examined, it is expunged if either
		''' the GC has determined that the iterator is discarded, or if the
		''' iterator reports that it is "detached" (does not need any
		''' further state updates).  Overhead is maximal when takeIndex
		''' never advances, iterators are discarded before they are
		''' exhausted, and all removals are interior removes, in which case
		''' all stale iterators are discovered by the GC.  But even in this
		''' case we don't increase the amortized complexity.
		''' 
		''' Care must be taken to keep list sweeping methods from
		''' reentrantly invoking another such method, causing subtle
		''' corruption bugs.
