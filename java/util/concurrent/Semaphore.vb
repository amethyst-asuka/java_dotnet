	''' <summary>
	''' A counting semaphore.  Conceptually, a semaphore maintains a set of
	''' permits.  Each <seealso cref="#acquire"/> blocks if necessary until a permit is
	''' available, and then takes it.  Each <seealso cref="#release"/> adds a permit,
	''' potentially releasing a blocking acquirer.
	''' However, no actual permit objects are used; the {@code Semaphore} just
	''' keeps a count of the number available and acts accordingly.
	''' 
	''' <p>Semaphores are often used to restrict the number of threads than can
	''' access some (physical or logical) resource. For example, here is
	''' a class that uses a semaphore to control access to a pool of items:
	'''  <pre> {@code
	''' class Pool {
	'''   private static final int MAX_AVAILABLE = 100;
	'''   private final Semaphore available = new Semaphore(MAX_AVAILABLE, true);
	''' 
	'''   public Object getItem() throws InterruptedException {
	'''     available.acquire();
	'''     return getNextAvailableItem();
	'''   }
	''' 
	'''   public void putItem(Object x) {
	'''     if (markAsUnused(x))
	'''       available.release();
	'''   }
	''' 
	'''   // Not a particularly efficient data structure; just for demo
	''' 
	'''   protected Object[] items = ... whatever kinds of items being managed
	'''   protected boolean[] used = new boolean[MAX_AVAILABLE];
	''' 
	'''   protected synchronized Object getNextAvailableItem() {
	'''     for (int i = 0; i < MAX_AVAILABLE; ++i) {
	'''       if (!used[i]) {
	'''          used[i] = true;
	'''          return items[i];
	'''       }
	'''     }
	'''     return null; // not reached
	'''   }
	''' 
	'''   protected synchronized boolean markAsUnused(Object item) {
	'''     for (int i = 0; i < MAX_AVAILABLE; ++i) {
	'''       if (item == items[i]) {
	'''          if (used[i]) {
	'''            used[i] = false;
	'''            return true;
	'''          } else
	'''            return false;
	'''       }
	'''     }
	'''     return false;
	'''   }
	''' }}</pre>
	''' 
	''' <p>Before obtaining an item each thread must acquire a permit from
	''' the semaphore, guaranteeing that an item is available for use. When
	''' the thread has finished with the item it is returned back to the
	''' pool and a permit is returned to the semaphore, allowing another
	''' thread to acquire that item.  Note that no synchronization lock is
	''' held when <seealso cref="#acquire"/> is called as that would prevent an item
	''' from being returned to the pool.  The semaphore encapsulates the
	''' synchronization needed to restrict access to the pool, separately
	''' from any synchronization needed to maintain the consistency of the
	''' pool itself.
	''' 
	''' <p>A semaphore initialized to one, and which is used such that it
	''' only has at most one permit available, can serve as a mutual
	''' exclusion lock.  This is more commonly known as a <em>binary
	''' semaphore</em>, because it only has two states: one permit
	''' available, or zero permits available.  When used in this way, the
	''' binary semaphore has the property (unlike many <seealso cref="java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock"/>
	''' implementations), that the &quot;lock&quot; can be released by a
	''' thread other than the owner (as semaphores have no notion of
	''' ownership).  This can be useful in some specialized contexts, such
	''' as deadlock recovery.
	''' 
	''' <p> The constructor for this class optionally accepts a
	''' <em>fairness</em> parameter. When set false, this class makes no
	''' guarantees about the order in which threads acquire permits. In
	''' particular, <em>barging</em> is permitted, that is, a thread
	''' invoking <seealso cref="#acquire"/> can be allocated a permit ahead of a
	''' thread that has been waiting - logically the new thread places itself at
	''' the head of the queue of waiting threads. When fairness is set true, the
	''' semaphore guarantees that threads invoking any of the {@link
	''' #acquire() acquire} methods are selected to obtain permits in the order in
	''' which their invocation of those methods was processed
	''' (first-in-first-out; FIFO). Note that FIFO ordering necessarily
	''' applies to specific internal points of execution within these
	''' methods.  So, it is possible for one thread to invoke
	''' {@code acquire} before another, but reach the ordering point after
	''' the other, and similarly upon return from the method.
	''' Also note that the untimed <seealso cref="#tryAcquire() tryAcquire"/> methods do not
	''' honor the fairness setting, but will take any permits that are
	''' available.
	''' 
	''' <p>Generally, semaphores used to control resource access should be
	''' initialized as fair, to ensure that no thread is starved out from
	''' accessing a resource. When using semaphores for other kinds of
	''' synchronization control, the throughput advantages of non-fair
	''' ordering often outweigh fairness considerations.
	''' 
	''' <p>This class also provides convenience methods to {@link
	''' #acquire(int) acquire} and <seealso cref="#release(int) release"/> multiple
	''' permits at a time.  Beware of the increased risk of indefinite
	''' postponement when these methods are used without fairness set true.
	''' 
	''' <p>Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to calling
	''' a "release" method such as {@code release()}
	''' <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
	''' actions following a successful "acquire" method such as {@code acquire()}
	''' in another thread.
