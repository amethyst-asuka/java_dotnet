	''' <summary>
	''' An unbounded <seealso cref="BlockingQueue blocking queue"/> that uses
	''' the same ordering rules As  [Class] <seealso cref="PriorityQueue"/> and supplies
	''' blocking retrieval operations.  While this queue is logically
	''' unbounded, attempted additions may fail due to resource exhaustion
	''' (causing {@code OutOfMemoryError}). This class does not permit
	''' {@code null} elements.  A priority queue relying on {@linkplain
	''' Comparable natural ordering} also does not permit insertion of
	''' non-comparable objects (doing so results in
	''' {@code ClassCastException}).
	''' 
	''' <p>This class and its iterator implement all of the
	''' <em>optional</em> methods of the <seealso cref="Collection"/> and {@link
	''' Iterator} interfaces.  The Iterator provided in method {@link
	''' #iterator()} is <em>not</em> guaranteed to traverse the elements of
	''' the PriorityBlockingQueue in any particular order. If you need
	''' ordered traversal, consider using
	''' {@code Arrays.sort(pq.toArray())}.  Also, method {@code drainTo}
	''' can be used to <em>remove</em> some or all elements in priority
	''' order and place them in another collection.
	''' 
	''' <p>Operations on this class make no guarantees about the ordering
	''' of elements with equal priority. If you need to enforce an
	''' ordering, you can define custom classes or comparators that use a
	''' secondary key to break ties in primary priority values.  For
	''' example, here is a class that applies first-in-first-out
	''' tie-breaking to comparable elements. To use it, you would insert a
	''' {@code new FIFOEntry(anEntry)} instead of a plain entry object.
	''' 
	'''  <pre> {@code
	''' class FIFOEntry<E extends Comparable<? super E>>
	'''     implements Comparable<FIFOEntry<E>> {
	'''   static final AtomicLong seq = new AtomicLong(0);
	'''   final long seqNum;
	'''   final E entry;
	'''   public FIFOEntry(E entry) {
	'''     seqNum = seq.getAndIncrement();
	'''     this.entry = entry;
	'''   }
	'''   public E getEntry() { return entry; }
	'''   public int compareTo(FIFOEntry<E> other) {
	'''     int res = entry.compareTo(other.entry);
	'''     if (res == 0 && other.entry != this.entry)
	'''       res = (seqNum < other.seqNum ? -1 : 1);
	'''     return res;

	'    
	'     * The implementation uses an array-based binary heap, with public
	'     * operations protected with a single lock. However, allocation
	'     * during resizing uses a simple spinlock (used only while not
	'     * holding main lock) in order to allow takes to operate
	'     * concurrently with allocation.  This avoids repeated
	'     * postponement of waiting consumers and consequent element
	'     * build-up. The need to back away from lock during allocation
	'     * makes it impossible to simply wrap delegated
	'     * java.util.PriorityQueue operations within a lock, as was done
	'     * in a previous version of this class. To maintain
	'     * interoperability, a plain PriorityQueue is still used during
	'     * serialization, which maintains compatibility at the expense of
	'     * transiently doubling overhead.
