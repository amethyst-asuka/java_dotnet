Namespace java.util.concurrent

	''' <summary>
	''' A service that decouples the production of new asynchronous tasks
	''' from the consumption of the results of completed tasks.  Producers
	''' {@code submit} tasks for execution. Consumers {@code take}
	''' completed tasks and process their results in the order they
	''' complete.  A {@code CompletionService} can for example be used to
	''' manage asynchronous I/O, in which tasks that perform reads are
	''' submitted in one part of a program or system, and then acted upon
	''' in a different part of the program when the reads complete,
	''' possibly in a different order than they were requested.
	''' 
	''' <p>Typically, a {@code CompletionService} relies on a separate
	''' <seealso cref="Executor"/> to actually execute the tasks, in which case the
	''' {@code CompletionService} only manages an internal completion
	''' queue. The <seealso cref="ExecutorCompletionService"/> class provides an
	''' implementation of this approach.
	''' 
	''' <p>Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to
	''' submitting a task to a {@code CompletionService}
	''' <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
	''' actions taken by that task, which in turn <i>happen-before</i>
	''' actions following a successful return from the corresponding {@code take()}.
	''' </summary>
