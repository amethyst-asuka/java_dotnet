	''' <summary>
	''' The class <code>Date</code> represents a specific instant
	''' in time, with millisecond precision.
	''' <p>
	''' Prior to JDK&nbsp;1.1, the class <code>Date</code> had two additional
	''' functions.  It allowed the interpretation of dates as year, month, day, hour,
	''' minute, and second values.  It also allowed the formatting and parsing
	''' of date strings.  Unfortunately, the API for these functions was not
	''' amenable to internationalization.  As of JDK&nbsp;1.1, the
	''' <code>Calendar</code> class should be used to convert between dates and time
	''' fields and the <code>DateFormat</code> class should be used to format and
	''' parse date strings.
	''' The corresponding methods in <code>Date</code> are deprecated.
	''' <p>
	''' Although the <code>Date</code> class is intended to reflect
	''' coordinated universal time (UTC), it may not do so exactly,
	''' depending on the host environment of the Java Virtual Machine.
	''' Nearly all modern operating systems assume that 1&nbsp;day&nbsp;=
	''' 24&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;60&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;60&nbsp;= 86400 seconds
	''' in all cases. In UTC, however, about once every year or two there
	''' is an extra second, called a "leap second." The leap
	''' second is always added as the last second of the day, and always
	''' on December 31 or June 30. For example, the last minute of the
	''' year 1995 was 61 seconds long, thanks to an added leap second.
	''' Most computer clocks are not accurate enough to be able to reflect
	''' the leap-second distinction.
	''' <p>
	''' Some computer standards are defined in terms of Greenwich mean
	''' time (GMT), which is equivalent to universal time (UT).  GMT is
	''' the "civil" name for the standard; UT is the
	''' "scientific" name for the same standard. The
	''' distinction between UTC and UT is that UTC is based on an atomic
	''' clock and UT is based on astronomical observations, which for all
	''' practical purposes is an invisibly fine hair to split. Because the
	''' earth's rotation is not uniform (it slows down and speeds up
	''' in complicated ways), UT does not always flow uniformly. Leap
	''' seconds are introduced as needed into UTC so as to keep UTC within
	''' 0.9 seconds of UT1, which is a version of UT with certain
	''' corrections applied. There are other time and date systems as
	''' well; for example, the time scale used by the satellite-based
	''' global positioning system (GPS) is synchronized to UTC but is
	''' <i>not</i> adjusted for leap seconds. An interesting source of
	''' further information is the U.S. Naval Observatory, particularly
	''' the Directorate of Time at:
	''' <blockquote><pre>
	'''     <a href=http://tycho.usno.navy.mil>http://tycho.usno.navy.mil</a>
	''' </pre></blockquote>
	''' <p>
	''' and their definitions of "Systems of Time" at:
	''' <blockquote><pre>
	'''     <a href=http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/systime.html>http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/systime.html</a>
	''' </pre></blockquote>
	''' <p>
	''' In all methods of class <code>Date</code> that accept or return
	''' year, month, date, hours, minutes, and seconds values, the
	''' following representations are used:
	''' <ul>
	''' <li>A year <i>y</i> is represented by the integer
	'''     <i>y</i>&nbsp;<code>-&nbsp;1900</code>.
	''' <li>A month is represented by an integer from 0 to 11; 0 is January,
	'''     1 is February, and so forth; thus 11 is December.
	''' <li>A date (day of month) is represented by an integer from 1 to 31
	'''     in the usual manner.
	''' <li>An hour is represented by an integer from 0 to 23. Thus, the hour
	'''     from midnight to 1 a.m. is hour 0, and the hour from noon to 1
	'''     p.m. is hour 12.
	''' <li>A minute is represented by an integer from 0 to 59 in the usual manner.
	''' <li>A second is represented by an integer from 0 to 61; the values 60 and
	'''     61 occur only for leap seconds and even then only in Java
	'''     implementations that actually track leap seconds correctly. Because
	'''     of the manner in which leap seconds are currently introduced, it is
	'''     extremely unlikely that two leap seconds will occur in the same
	'''     minute, but this specification follows the date and time conventions
	'''     for ISO C.
	''' </ul>
	''' <p>
	''' In all cases, arguments given to methods for these purposes need
	''' not fall within the indicated ranges; for example, a date may be
	''' specified as January 32 and is interpreted as meaning February 1.

		''' A consecutive sequence of decimal digits is treated as a decimal
		''' number:<ul>
		''' <li>If a number is preceded by <tt>+</tt> or <tt>-</tt> and a year
		'''     has already been recognized, then the number is a time-zone
		'''     offset. If the number is less than 24, it is an offset measured
		'''     in hours. Otherwise, it is regarded as an offset in minutes,
		'''     expressed in 24-hour time format without punctuation. A
		'''     preceding <tt>-</tt> means a westward offset. Time zone offsets
		'''     are always relative to UTC (Greenwich). Thus, for example,
		'''     <tt>-5</tt> occurring in the string would mean "five hours west
		'''     of Greenwich" and <tt>+0430</tt> would mean "four hours and
		'''     thirty minutes east of Greenwich." It is permitted for the
		'''     string to specify <tt>GMT</tt>, <tt>UT</tt>, or <tt>UTC</tt>
		'''     redundantly-for example, <tt>GMT-5</tt> or <tt>utc+0430</tt>.
		''' <li>The number is regarded as a year number if one of the
		'''     following conditions is true:
		''' <ul>
		'''     <li>The number is equal to or greater than 70 and followed by a
		'''         space, comma, slash, or end of string
		'''     <li>The number is less than 70, and both a month and a day of
		'''         the month have already been recognized</li>
		''' </ul>
		'''     If the recognized year number is less than 100, it is
		'''     interpreted as an abbreviated year relative to a century of
		'''     which dates are within 80 years before and 19 years after
		'''     the time when the Date class is initialized.
		'''     After adjusting the year number, 1900 is subtracted from
		'''     it. For example, if the current year is 1999 then years in
		'''     the range 19 to 99 are assumed to mean 1919 to 1999, while
		'''     years from 0 to 18 are assumed to mean 2000 to 2018.  Note
		'''     that this is slightly different from the interpretation of
		'''     years less than 100 that is used in <seealso cref="java.text.SimpleDateFormat"/>.
		''' <li>If the number is followed by a colon, it is regarded as an hour,
		'''     unless an hour has already been recognized, in which case it is
		'''     regarded as a minute.
		''' <li>If the number is followed by a slash, it is regarded as a month
		'''     (it is decreased by 1 to produce a number in the range <tt>0</tt>
		'''     to <tt>11</tt>), unless a month has already been recognized, in
		'''     which case it is regarded as a day of the month.
		''' <li>If the number is followed by whitespace, a comma, a hyphen, or
		'''     end of string, then if an hour has been recognized but not a
		'''     minute, it is regarded as a minute; otherwise, if a minute has
		'''     been recognized but not a second, it is regarded as a second;
		'''     otherwise, it is regarded as a day of the month. </ul><p>
		''' A consecutive sequence of letters is regarded as a word and treated

		'''     than <tt>1</tt> or greater than <tt>12</tt>).
