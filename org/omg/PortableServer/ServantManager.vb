	''' A servant manager supplies a POA with the ability 
	''' to activate objects on demand when the POA receives 
	''' a request targeted at an inactive object. A servant 
	''' manager is registered with a POA as a callback object, 
	''' to be invoked by the POA when necessary.
	''' ServantManagers can either be ServantActivators or
	''' ServantLocators. A ServantManager object must be 
	''' local to the process containing the POA objects 
	''' it is registered with.
