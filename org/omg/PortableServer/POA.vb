	''' A POA object manages the implementation of a 
	''' collection of objects. The POA supports a name space 
	''' for the objects, which are identified by Object Ids. 
	''' A POA also provides a name space for POAs. A POA is 
	''' created as a child of an existing POA, which forms a 
	''' hierarchy starting with the root POA. A POA object 
	''' must not be exported to other processes, or 
	''' externalized with ORB::object_to_string.
