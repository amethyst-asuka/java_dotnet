	''' <summary>
	''' When the POA has the NON_RETAIN policy it uses servant 
	''' managers that are ServantLocators. Because the POA 
	''' knows that the servant returned by this servant 
	''' manager will be used only for a single request, 
	''' it can supply extra information to the servant 
	''' manager's operations and the servant manager's pair 
	''' of operations may be able to cooperate to do 
	''' something different than a ServantActivator. 
	''' When the POA uses the ServantLocator interface, 
	''' immediately after performing the operation invocation 
	''' on the servant returned by preinvoke, the POA will 
	''' invoke postinvoke on the servant manager, passing the 
	''' ObjectId value and the Servant value as parameters 
	''' (among others). This feature may be used to force 
	''' every request for objects associated with a POA to 
	''' be mediated by the servant manager.
