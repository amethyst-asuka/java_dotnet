	''' The formats of IOR components and service context data used by ORB 
	''' services are often defined as CDR encapsulations encoding instances 
	''' of IDL defined data types. The <code>Codec</code> provides a mechanism 
	''' to transfer these components between their IDL data types and their CDR 
	''' encapsulation representations. 
	''' <p>
	''' A <code>Codec</code> is obtained from the <code>CodecFactory</code>. 
	''' The <code>CodecFactory</code> is obtained through a call to 
	''' <code>ORB.resolve_initial_references( "CodecFactory" )</code>.
