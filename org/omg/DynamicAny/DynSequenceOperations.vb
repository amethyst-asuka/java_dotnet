	  Function get_length() As Integer

	  ''' <summary>
	  ''' Sets the length of the sequence.
	  ''' Increasing the length of a sequence adds new elements at the tail without affecting the values
	  ''' of already existing elements. Newly added elements are default-initialized.
	  ''' Increasing the length of a sequence sets the current position to the first newly-added element
	  ''' if the previous current position was -1. Otherwise, if the previous current position was not -1,
	  ''' the current position is not affected.
	  ''' Decreasing the length of a sequence removes elements from the tail without affecting the value
	  ''' of those elements that remain. The new current position after decreasing the length of a sequence
	  ''' is determined as follows:
	  ''' <UL>
	  ''' <LI>If the length of the sequence is set to zero, the current position is set to -1.
	  ''' <LI>If the current position is -1 before decreasing the length, it remains at -1.
	  ''' <LI>If the current position indicates a valid element and that element is not removed when the length
	  '''     is decreased, the current position remains unaffected.
	  ''' <LI>If the current position indicates a valid element and that element is removed,
	  '''     the current position is set to -1.
