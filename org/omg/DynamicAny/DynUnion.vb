	''' <summary>
	''' DynUnion objects support the manipulation of IDL unions.
	''' A union can have only two valid current positions:
	''' <UL>
	''' <LI>zero, which denotes the discriminator
	''' <LI>one, which denotes the active member
	''' </UL>
	''' The component_count value for a union depends on the current discriminator:
	''' it is 2 for a union whose discriminator indicates a named member, and 1 otherwise.
