	''' <summary>
	''' This class represents the result of resolution of a name.
	''' It contains the object to which name was resolved, and the portion
	''' of the name that has not been resolved.
	''' <p>
	''' A ResolveResult instance is not synchronized against concurrent
	''' multithreaded access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify
	''' a single ResolveResult instance should lock the object.
