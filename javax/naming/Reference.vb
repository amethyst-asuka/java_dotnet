	''' <summary>
	''' This class represents a reference to an object that is found outside of
	''' the naming/directory system.
	''' <p>
	''' Reference provides a way of recording address information about
	''' objects which themselves are not directly bound to the naming/directory system.
	''' <p>
	''' A Reference consists of an ordered list of addresses and class information
	''' about the object being referenced.
	''' Each address in the list identifies a communications endpoint
	''' for the same conceptual object.  The "communications endpoint"
	''' is information that indicates how to contact the object. It could
	''' be, for example, a network address, a location in memory on the
	''' local machine, another process on the same machine, etc.
	''' The order of the addresses in the list may be of significance
	''' to object factories that interpret the reference.
	''' <p>
	''' Multiple addresses may arise for
	''' various reasons, such as replication or the object offering interfaces
	''' over more than one communication mechanism.  The addresses are indexed
	''' starting with zero.
	''' <p>
	''' A Reference also contains information to assist in creating an instance
	''' of the object to which this Reference refers.  It contains the class name
	''' of that object, and the class name and location of the factory to be used
	''' to create the object.
	''' The class factory location is a space-separated list of URLs representing
	''' the class path used to load the factory.  When the factory class (or
	''' any class or resource upon which it depends) needs to be loaded,
	''' each URL is used (in order) to attempt to load the class.
	''' <p>
	''' A Reference instance is not synchronized against concurrent access by multiple
	''' threads. Threads that need to access a single Reference concurrently should
	''' synchronize amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking.
