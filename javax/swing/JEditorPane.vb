	''' <summary>
	''' A text component to edit various kinds of content.
	''' You can find how-to information and examples of using editor panes in
	''' <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/text.html">Using Text Components</a>,
	''' a section in <em>The Java Tutorial.</em>
	''' 
	''' <p>
	''' This component uses implementations of the
	''' <code>EditorKit</code> to accomplish its behavior. It effectively
	''' morphs into the proper kind of text editor for the kind
	''' of content it is given.  The content type that editor is bound
	''' to at any given time is determined by the <code>EditorKit</code> currently
	''' installed.  If the content is set to a new URL, its type is used
	''' to determine the <code>EditorKit</code> that should be used to
	''' load the content.
	''' <p>
	''' By default, the following types of content are known:
	''' <dl>
	''' <dt><b>text/plain</b>
	''' <dd>Plain text, which is the default the type given isn't
	''' recognized.  The kit used in this case is an extension of
	''' <code>DefaultEditorKit</code> that produces a wrapped plain text view.
	''' <dt><b>text/html</b>
	''' <dd>HTML text.  The kit used in this case is the class
	''' <code>javax.swing.text.html.HTMLEditorKit</code>
	''' which provides HTML 3.2 support.
	''' <dt><b>text/rtf</b>
	''' <dd>RTF text.  The kit used in this case is the class
	''' <code>javax.swing.text.rtf.RTFEditorKit</code>
	''' which provides a limited support of the Rich Text Format.
	''' </dl>
	''' <p>
	''' There are several ways to load content into this component.
	''' <ol>
	''' <li>
	''' The <seealso cref="#setText setText"/> method can be used to initialize
	''' the component from a string.  In this case the current
	''' <code>EditorKit</code> will be used, and the content type will be
	''' expected to be of this type.
	''' <li>
	''' The <seealso cref="#read read"/> method can be used to initialize the
	''' component from a <code>Reader</code>.  Note that if the content type is HTML,
	''' relative references (e.g. for things like images) can't be resolved
	''' unless the &lt;base&gt; tag is used or the <em>Base</em> property
	''' on <code>HTMLDocument</code> is set.
	''' In this case the current <code>EditorKit</code> will be used,
	''' and the content type will be expected to be of this type.
	''' <li>
	''' The <seealso cref="#setPage setPage"/> method can be used to initialize
	''' the component from a URL.  In this case, the content type will be
	''' determined from the URL, and the registered <code>EditorKit</code>
	''' for that content type will be set.
	''' </ol>
	''' <p>
	''' Some kinds of content may provide hyperlink support by generating
	''' hyperlink events.  The HTML <code>EditorKit</code> will generate
	''' hyperlink events if the <code>JEditorPane</code> is <em>not editable</em>
	''' (<code>JEditorPane.setEditable(false);</code> has been called).
	''' If HTML frames are embedded in the document, the typical response would be
	''' to change a portion of the current document.  The following code
	''' fragment is a possible hyperlink listener implementation, that treats
	''' HTML frame events specially, and simply displays any other activated
	''' hyperlinks.
	''' <pre>
	''' 
	''' &nbsp;    class Hyperactive implements HyperlinkListener {
	''' &nbsp;
	''' &nbsp;        public void hyperlinkUpdate(HyperlinkEvent e) {
	''' &nbsp;            if (e.getEventType() == HyperlinkEvent.EventType.ACTIVATED) {
	''' &nbsp;                JEditorPane pane = (JEditorPane) e.getSource();
	''' &nbsp;                if (e instanceof HTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent) {
	''' &nbsp;                    HTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent  evt = (HTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent)e;
	''' &nbsp;                    HTMLDocument doc = (HTMLDocument)pane.getDocument();
	''' &nbsp;                    doc.processHTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent(evt);
	''' &nbsp;                } else {
	''' &nbsp;                    try {
	''' &nbsp;                        pane.setPage(e.getURL());
	''' &nbsp;                    } catch (Throwable t) {
	''' &nbsp;                        t.printStackTrace();
	''' &nbsp;                    }
	''' &nbsp;                }
	''' &nbsp;            }
	''' &nbsp;        }
	''' &nbsp;    }
	''' 
	''' </pre>
	''' <p>
	''' For information on customizing how <b>text/html</b> is rendered please see
	''' <seealso cref="#W3C_LENGTH_UNITS"/> and <seealso cref="#HONOR_DISPLAY_PROPERTIES"/>
	''' <p>
	''' Culturally dependent information in some documents is handled through
	''' a mechanism called character encoding.  Character encoding is an
	''' unambiguous mapping of the members of a character set (letters, ideographs,
	''' digits, symbols, or control functions) to specific numeric code values. It
	''' represents the way the file is stored. Example character encodings are
	''' ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-5, Shift-jis, Euc-jp, and UTF-8. When the file is
	''' passed to an user agent (<code>JEditorPane</code>) it is converted to
	''' the document character set (ISO-10646 aka Unicode).
	''' <p>
	''' There are multiple ways to get a character set mapping to happen
	''' with <code>JEditorPane</code>.
	''' <ol>
	''' <li>
	''' One way is to specify the character set as a parameter of the MIME
	''' type.  This will be established by a call to the
	''' <seealso cref="#setContentType setContentType"/> method.  If the content
	''' is loaded by the <seealso cref="#setPage setPage"/> method the content
	''' type will have been set according to the specification of the URL.
	''' It the file is loaded directly, the content type would be expected to
	''' have been set prior to loading.
	''' <li>
	''' Another way the character set can be specified is in the document itself.
	''' This requires reading the document prior to determining the character set
	''' that is desired.  To handle this, it is expected that the
	''' <code>EditorKit</code>.read operation throw a
	''' <code>ChangedCharSetException</code> which will
	''' be caught.  The read is then restarted with a new Reader that uses
	''' the character set specified in the <code>ChangedCharSetException</code>
	''' (which is an <code>IOException</code>).
