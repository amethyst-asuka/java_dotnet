Namespace javax.lang.model.element

	''' <summary>
	''' Represents a class or interface program element.  Provides access
	''' to information about the type and its members.  Note that an enum
	''' type is a kind of class and an annotation type is a kind of
	''' interface.
	''' 
	''' <p> <a name="ELEM_VS_TYPE"></a>
	''' While a {@code TypeElement} represents a class or interface
	''' <i>element</i>, a <seealso cref="DeclaredType"/> represents a class
	''' or interface <i>type</i>, the latter being a use
	''' (or <i>invocation</i>) of the former.
	''' The distinction is most apparent with generic types,
	''' for which a single element can define a whole
	''' family of types.  For example, the element
	''' {@code java.util.Set} corresponds to the parameterized types
	''' {@code java.util.Set<String>} and {@code java.util.Set<Number>}
	''' (and many others), and to the raw type {@code java.util.Set}.
	''' 
	''' <p> Each method of this interface that returns a list of elements
	''' will return them in the order that is natural for the underlying
	''' source of program information.  For example, if the underlying
	''' source of information is Java source code, then the elements will be
	''' returned in source code order.

        ''' Returns the fields, methods, constructors, and member types

        ''' ordering behavior required of this interface, the list of
        ''' enclosed elements will be returned in the natural order for the
        ''' originating source of information about the type.  For example,
        ''' if the information about the type is originating from a source
        ''' file, the elements will be returned in source code order.
