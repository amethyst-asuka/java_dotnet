Namespace javax.lang.model.type


	''' <summary>
	''' Represents an intersection type.
	''' 
	''' <p>An intersection type can be either implicitly or explicitly
	''' declared in a program. For example, the bound of the type parameter
	''' {@code <T extends Number & Runnable>} is an (implicit) intersection
	''' type.  As of {@link javax.lang.model.SourceVersion#RELEASE_8
	''' RELEASE_8}, this is represented by an {@code IntersectionType} with
	''' {@code Number} and {@code Runnable} as its bounds.
	''' 
	''' @implNote Also as of {@link
	''' javax.lang.model.SourceVersion#RELEASE_8 RELEASE_8}, in the
	''' reference implementation an {@code IntersectionType} is used to
	''' model the explicit target type of a cast expression.
	''' 
	''' @since 1.8
