	''' AccessibleContext represents the minimum information all accessible objects
	''' return.  This information includes the accessible name, description, role,
	''' and state of the object, as well as information about its parent and
	''' children.  AccessibleContext also contains methods for
	''' obtaining more specific accessibility information about a component.
	''' If the component supports them, these methods will return an object that
	''' implements one or more of the following interfaces:
	''' <P><ul>
	''' <li><seealso cref="AccessibleAction"/> - the object can perform one or more actions.
	''' This interface provides the standard mechanism for an assistive
	''' technology to determine what those actions are and tell the object
	''' to perform them.  Any object that can be manipulated should
	''' support this interface.
	''' <li><seealso cref="AccessibleComponent"/> - the object has a graphical representation.
	''' This interface provides the standard mechanism for an assistive
	''' technology to determine and set the graphical representation of the
	''' object.  Any object that is rendered on the screen should support
	''' this interface.
	''' <li><seealso cref=" AccessibleSelection"/> - the object allows its children to be
	''' selected.  This interface provides the standard mechanism for an
	''' assistive technology to determine the currently selected children of the object
	''' as well as modify its selection set.  Any object that has children
	''' that can be selected should support this interface.
	''' <li><seealso cref="AccessibleText"/> - the object presents editable textual information
	''' on the display.  This interface provides the standard mechanism for
	''' an assistive technology to access that text via its content, attributes,
	''' and spatial location.  Any object that contains editable text should
	''' support this interface.
	''' <li><seealso cref="AccessibleValue"/> - the object supports a numerical value.  This
	''' interface provides the standard mechanism for an assistive technology
	''' to determine and set the current value of the object, as well as obtain its
	''' minimum and maximum values.  Any object that supports a numerical value
	''' should support this interface.</ul>
